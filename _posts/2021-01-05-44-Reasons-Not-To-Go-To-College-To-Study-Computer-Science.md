# 44 Reasons Not To Go To College To Study Computer Science

I firmly believe that college is a good thing. Good, in the broadest sense of the term, in that education is good. But there are downsides to taking on debt, even the smallest bit of debt, while in your teens. The system is broken if teens can't pay for their college through summer jobs. There should be zero debt from going to a public college. Fortunately, you can get a very good education online and through philanthropic colleges that CAN be paid for through summer jobs. And there is more free education material online than you could ever work through in a hundred lifetimes. The problem of college debt has been solved: Don't go into debt at all for tertiary education, even if that means not going to college to study computer science. It's just that people don't know about it because people don't know about open source. Until community/public college is free (give it fifty years), there is no need to go into debt when you can learn online for a couple hamiltons a month.

I am a proponent of going to college to study computer science-- as long as that college is in your hometown so you can live at home when you go to school, and it is a public school. My guess is, if you are smart enough to be a programmer, you are smart enough to get a scholarship at a local public school. Maybe not a full ride (though National Merit Scholarship all but assures you of a full ride at an in-state public school), but at least enough to keep costs low. I think if you are in high school the smartest thing you can do is study SAT prep on Khan Academy or through books from Library Genesis, matched with vocabulary lists downloaded and studied for free on Anki. The small amount of preparation it takes in order to score well on the SAT/ACT/PSAT is worth its weight in gold when you land a scholarship as a result of studying for them. That was what I chose to do in High School. I took the PSAT in seventh grade, and as a result of scoring well was enrolled in the TIP program at Duke. My best friend and I were able to go to a summer computer camp at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, GA where I studied BASIC. I had already taught myself BASIC in sixth grade and HTML in seventh, so this was an opportunity to take a few weeks and really spend time on programming tutorials and hone my skills. It was at that summer camp that I decided I wanted to be a computer programmer when I grew up because of how impressed I was by the camp counselors. I had wanted to be a scientist since first grade, but that was when I knew computers would play a big role.

So in high school, instead of working for $6.50 an hour I took every single AP class offered by my school. By the time I graduated I had taken every single AP class offered except Calc BC (because it conflicted with AP Art History) and the second semester of AP Statistics. This paid for itself much more than working a high school job. For a $150 test at the end of the year, you earned a semesters worth of college credit. Not even University of the People is $150 for a semester class. This credit was accepted at every college, whether a community college or the Ivy League. The additional benefit of taking AP classes was that the GPA was weighted, so an A was worth a 5.0. I started taking AP classes my sophomore year of high school. By the time I applied for colleges, I was first in my class. Not only was I receiving college credit for $150 (and free textbooks provided by the high school, I might add), I had also helped my ranking immensely. Because I was first in my class, I was accepted into the schools I wanted to go to (Reed and the University of Chicago) and received a full ride from my state school, KU. I chose the college that gave me the largest scholarship, Reed, in which I earned the Presidential Scholarship which converted all my non-Pell loan amounts into grant dollars. Reed College ended up costing roughly $15,000 a year, still a hefty sum but in essence I had earned a scholarship worth $72,000. Earning $72,000 as a high schooler is a good advance, and I don't regret not having worked in high school when I came out of high school a hardened scientist, knowledgable in STEM and mathematics as well as the humanities. All I'm saying is that, if you work hard as a high schooler, you can earn a healthy income even if you don't work at a minimum wage job. Trust me that, you guessed it, studying STEM is the best use of your time and every hour and opportunity you have during the day to study STEM should be dedicated to that task, and that there are many opportunities even in high school to earn an income as a scientist just through potential scholarships as a result of ranking well in your high school class. I also prepared for the SAT and ACT very hard, studying my vocabulary flashcards and math. Those also helped me earn scholarships at the schools I applied. Not only was I prepared to do well as a STEM student at college, but I was able to go to an expensive out of state private school for the equivalent cost of a state university. I made the opportunity cost of not working a minimum wage job as a high schooler (so I wasn't able to buy fancy shit or whatever high schoolers with minimum wage jobs buy), but it paid for itself through AP credit and scholarships. Again, don't view high school as a waste of time and a barrier if you want to be a computer scientist. Instead you should see it as a factory that will pay you handsomely if you do nothing other than follow your dream of wanting to be a scientist. If you work hard at the sciences and don't piddle away your time for $6.50 an hour, you'll find yourself with a full ride to a state university at the end of high school (especially if you are a National Merit Scholar). As soon as I graduated from high school I worked during the summer as a lifeguard (so that I could afford to buy a new Apple computer when I went off to school -- which was a mistake. I should have invested the money in a Vanguard IRA and used an old free computer running linux. C'est la vie...).

Frugality is a mixed bag. Sometimes strategically not working can essentially earn you more money. You have to know what is expected and what the possibilities of education are. Sometimes it makes more sense to go to college, and sometimes it makes more sense to work a job. You basically have to learn to gauge the weather forecast in this way by reading books about universities. I am at the stage in life where pursuing a PhD in CS would hinder my earnings, so there is no need to enroll at a university when my life will be more fulfilling by working. In high school it made more sense to study science than to work, and as a result I earned scholarships worth tens of thousands of dollars because I used my precious time to study STEM. I had an advantage, just because I scored well on the PSAT in middle school, I was able to study with camp counselors at a university. I was acquiring the knowledge of what was required and expected to be a computer scientist at the age of 12. As a result, I went home and kept studying HTML and made myself a decently popular web page my eighth grade year. My best friend studied Java and started programming and modding LucasArts video games (my best friend now has a PhD in astronomy and is an engineer at Raytheon). We went to college in seventh grade and as a result knew what we had to do in high school in order to afford and succeed at college. We were very lucky and I'm still counting my blessings I went to that computer camp. Sometimes being a scientist can be a little bit lonesome, especially when you have to study math or chemistry in your room at night when it seems other people are working at jobs that afford them cars and such or else partying, but STEM is ultimately the right choice of profession if you are capable of doing it and have an interest. The pay is good and I'll tell you-- after obtaining a liberal arts degree-- the university experience is much more practical. Few things are more awesome than being a scientist, and after experiencing what working in the humanities was like, I will never do anything that isn't STEM. Hard work is rewarded in the sciences, whereas hard work means nothing in the humanities (it is all an issue of politics/are-you-committed-to-social-justice-and-socialism-as-much-as-your-boss instead). It's funny, but if you are interested in and committed to the Enlightenment, your time is better spent in the science department than the humanities department. Enlightenment thought is beloved by scientists, whereas mention the Enlightenment in the humanities and you'll be lectured about how the left has many "very good" critiques of liberal democracy. Sure... sure... let me get right on that...

So I am of course beleaguered to start a series on this blog called "40 Reasons Not To Go To College to Study Computer Science." College can be great-- if you earned a full ride scholarship. But sometimes that doesn't happen. Sometimes you had to work that minimum wage job as a high schooler, and as a result your grades suffered. Sometimes you weren't sure what you wanted to do when you grew up, so you didn't prep yourself out with STEM AP classes. Unfortunately colleges basically prey on these types of people, quite unfairly I might add. Just because you didn't walk in through the hollowed gates a professional scientist, you are basically exploited in a way that can cause a lifetime of misery. I think private colleges cost something like $60,000 a year nowadays (that's how much RPI cost when I worked there). This is seriously dangerous. Colleges know that employers expect a college degree, and as a result they are willing to charge young adults $5000 a month just to be a student. There are few things worth $5000 a month, especially when you've never worked a professional job (something that _pays_ $5000 a month). It is in that spirit that I present the blog series. I think technology has essentially answered the question of whether a computer science degree is worth paying for if you didn't earn a full ride scholarship. And I believe that answer to be "no". College is a great experience, and it's a complete shame that it costs so much, especially when our parent's generation got to experience it at affordable rates. It's so funny that "non-profits" are some of the greatest exploitators of young people of our time. If I were able to charge $60,000 a year in order to get an 18 year old to read 2,000 pages of text and write a few cursory programs, I'd be a capitalist genius. Let alone call myself a "non-profit". What an irony one of the greatest expenses every incurred by a person, one that causes immensely painful and burdensome debt, is done by an entity called a non-profit.

Here's a non-profit for you: Open Source Educational Technology. Try a year of that for free and tell me what you can do and earn for your efforts versus paying $60,000 to a "non-profit". You know, as someone that survived a humanities degree, I think it's ironic that something that positions itself as "socialist" causes some of the largest debt to children in the entire history of the world. The humanities department are filled with trust-fund socialists, but they work at a "non-profit" that milks hundreds of thousands of dollars from 20 year olds. That is just one of the reasons I despise socialism, because socialists are some of the greediest people I have ever met. They thrive at greedy institutions. They'll plaster "non-profit" and "brotherhood" on their advertisements and brochures, because they're oh-so-philanthropic, you know, but all the while stabbing you in the back and stealing your purse (and future) while churning out passive aggressive book after passive aggressive book about how the free markets are evil, the Enlightenment was worse than Hitler, and big-S Science is patriarchal and colonial. Shove it up your ass, universities. You exist as social welfare for druggies that "write well", all while causing nothing irreversible monetary pain to naive, optimistic, but innocent high schooler students. I'm not against free thought and diversity of opinions, but charging $60,000 a year for what amounts to socialist brainwashing akin to The Peoples Temple and Jonestown is absurd. This shit has to end and that's why I put my trust in open source educational technology as the future of computer science education and training rather than universities. I'm writing a blog and creating github repositories in order to promote OER as a vehicle of becoming a programmer outside of the bounds of university. I'm not a right-winger, I'm a secular humanist, and for some reason universities are viewed as the hotbed of secular humanism. I knew I thought I was walking into secular humanism studying the _humanities_ at college, but the experience was quite the opposite of humanism. I instead find humanism in open source educational technology, a vehicle for humanism that charges nothing for its consumption.

So I propose, simply, that college should be skipped. If you aren't suffering in a liberal arts department, your friend probably is. I personally think the liberal arts should be jettisoned from universities (if you want to read the classics and Great Books you can read them free on Project Gutenberg) and it should instead just be STEM. But until that happens, and the humanities are still beating the dead horse that is socialism and anarchism, I propose finding a way to "hack" your own DIY computer science education on the internet. I think you'll find that, if you work hard, you can become a competant enough programmer to land a first job, at which point your job will probably pay for tuition reimbursement if you want to get a degree anyway or you can work/study your way into a new job that does. You learn the most important stuff regarding programming on-the-job anyway, there is little in university that prepares you for actual computer science work. The real computer science education comes from the job. People forget this, or don't learn this, and fetishize university as the only source of computer science knowledge. Fortunately that isn't the case. Otherwise we would all be beholden to tens of thousands of dollars of debt just to be able to work. Fortunately most of what is required to land a first programming job can be learned in about two years of hard work. Everything after that can be learned on-the-job, while you're earning a paycheck and maxing out your 401(k) and IRA each year while you're young for that fat compound interest.

So come explore with me: 44 Reasons Not To Go To College to Study Computer Science. If you're smart enough to program, you should have the confidence that you're smart enough to educate yourself in computer science, debt-free.


## #44 - Bootstrap Your Computer Science Career

Here's a way to start a career as a developer for minimal investment -- only the cost of a Raspberry Pi and broadband.

Start off by reading books from your public library's computer programming stacks. Start off with a programming language like Java or C++, which your library is likely to cover. If your library has newer programming books, perhaps you can find one on Node or modern JavaScript. Start off with your local public library. Reading through a thick programming book designed to take you from the basics to some fairly advanced topics will teach you how to read computer science textbooks by following along by typing the code at home or at the library. By reading a big book on Java or C++, or newer languages if your public library is well funded, can introduce you to computer programming much more thoroughly than video tutorials can. You should spend as much of your time as you can in the programming stacks at your public library. This should be the source of your programming lessons for as long as you feasibly can draw value out of it. This is free, and computer programming books aren't cheap, so those books are a good resource. This will make you comfortable enough in programming in a single language or two so that you can begin broadening your languages as well as studying more advanced topics.

If your public library is well stocked, I could easily see spending a year just reading through their programming stack. Public Libraries unfortunately don't carry computer science books, I've found, so don't expect to study computer science topics at the public library. But for now, you should feel comfortable programming simple apps and enjoy reading through thick programming language books.

After spending as much time as feasibly possible in your public library programming stacks, you should begin to explore your public library's video tutorial services for more advanced computer programming topics. My public library, for example, subscribes to Treehouse and Lynda. These services cover many issues related to computer science and programming, and are a very good resource for learning new frameworks and languages. Treehouse is basically a computer science college degree for free, and Lynda has helped me on the path to mastering frameworks. Video tutorials require a computer with dual monitors, so if you don't have a second monitor you might want to invest in a cheap or used ipad to watch the programming tutorials on. Obviously buy a stand for it too. Using your public library's video tutorial resources will let you explore advanced programming topics while still being completely free. Video tutorials aren't great for learning how to program (although you are free to try to do so if you find it works), but once you learn the basics of programming, then you can quickly build your library of languages in which you are comfortable programming. Lynda has a very large database of lessons, and you could spend many years studying there. Treehouse is basically four years worth of programming lessons. The limit to your knowledge is only restricted by the amount of time you put into these resources. We live in an amazing age where video tutorials equivalent to thousands of textbooks are affordable enough for public libraries to subscribe to on behalf of their patrons. See what your public library offers, and hopefully they subscribe (or will subscribe upon some prodding) to Lynda or Treehouse.

After you expend every resource your public library offers, it's time to start studying computer science specifically. You can use the [curriculum](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html) compiled here as a guideline for your study of computer science. You can obviously skip the beginning programming lessons on the curriculum, and instead start with the computer science topics. Here you'll be able to study OER for free, or else reverse engineer syllabi from colleges and universities and read their assigned textbooks for free using Library Genesis. You aren't necessarily focusing on programming, though if you find OpenCourseWare that provides problem sets for homework that use programming. You're trying to learn enough about computer science that you can be literate regarding programming topics when you get your first job as a programmer. This doesn't require a master's, but it does require that you put aside the programming videos for a while and study the academic stuff for a year or two. It's not like this should be a burden - computer science topics are fun and exciting to study. But you're not going to learn those topics from your public library's resources. Instead you will have to rely on OER, Library Genesis, MOOCs, and OpenCourseWare. Again, you can download the syllabi from the first couple years of student classes at a good university and reverse engineer the reading list and problem sets. Rely on OpenCourseWare (we link to many online databases of online OCW classes and YouTube playlists in the [Guide](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-02-How-To-Be-A-Not-Rich-Computer-Scientist.html) section) to get you through this phase. You will be flying solo in preparation for your first programming job. If you aren't familiar with OpenCourseWare, now is the time to delve into the resources provided by universities for your own personal studies. They are extremely helpful.

Now you're about three years into your intensive exploration of programming. Now you'll want to subscribe to PluralSight for a year to round out the frameworks and topics you know. PluralSight is $200 a year. You can study non-programming topics like how to build a career, find a first job, develop a good resume (I suggest making a github pages website for a resume), and have a successful technology career. You should study these along with learning frameworks relevant to the career you want to start. Studying PluralSight topics intensively for a year will help you prepare for a first career. You'll develop your resume by researching advanced topics related to programming, and you'll be able to do things like start making demo programs or websites. PluralSight is a very good resource for only $200 a year. Continue studying computer science topics using your previous means and finishing up the loose ends of yours studies in order to obtain your first job.

In your first job, now that you've been studying computer science for four years, make sure that you get tuition reimbursement as a benefit. You can try and negotiate this if it doesn't, but your job should give you reimbursement especially since you skipped college and need to finish that task up. Don't pay for university credits yourself, that's a huge waste of money and unneeded given all the free and cheap resources available on the internet. But since you are self-taught, you're definitely going to want your employer to pay for your college side-study. The benefit will be a small amount (in my case, it is $3000 a year) or else a percentage of the tuition fee. You are going to be studying computer science at the most affordable online universities (University of the People and Georgia Tech OMSCS), so it'll be as affordable as possible. When you are working in your first job, you are going to want to enroll in University of the People. For the next four years you'll be taking online classes towards a programming degree. Even though you may consider yourself a good enough programmer that you don't want to take beginning programming classes, it'll actually be useful to get accreditation because you're going to want to eventually get a master's degree using your tuition reimbursement, so you need to finish up a bachelor's degree. University of the People will be a breeze because you already know how to program. University of People costs $1000 a year, so your tuition reimbursement should definitely cover it or else the percentage cost passed to you will be small. There's no need to pay for university out of your own pocket, now that there are cheap online CS educations like UoPeople and GT OMSCS. These could be good options for getting your first job if you work part time to pay their tuition price, but it is also nice to be able to pay for these for free through tuition reimbursement. 

While working your first computer science job, you will want to continue to use PluralSight and other online resources to keep abreast of the topics and frameworks related to your job. Perhaps your employer will pay for your PluralSight as an education cost for you (mine does). You'll be working on your UoPeople degree and Georgia Tech OMSCS degree for a number of years while you work. It'll keep you extremely occupied and busy, but the reward for having a master's degree in computer science will be worth it in terms of salary potential. Live as frugally as possible and save 50-80% of your pay by maxing out your 401k and IRA, and putting the rest in a post-tax investment account at Vanguard. Choose total stock market index funds (VTSAX), or else [make the equivalent in large-, mid-, and small-cap index funds](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/02/stocks-part-xvii-what-if-you-cant-buy-vtsax-or-even-vanguard/) (81% large, 6% mid, 13% small), or just invest in your fund's S&P 500 index fund if that's the only index fund offered. Remember: only invest in index funds, never active mutual funds. Index funds have an expense ratio of 0.04-0.3, depending on your plan. Take advantage of tax-deferred accounts like your 401K and IRA while you're young by maxing them out each year. Doing that for a decade in your twenties will provide you a huge amount of money to retire on at age 60. Any money saved after maxing out your pre-tax accounts can go into a post-tax account at Vanguard, [which will begin accumulating value in order to fund an early retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/11/29/how-to-retire-forever-on-a-fixed-chunk-of-money/) by providing returns which you can live off of before you turn 60 and finally have access to your 401k and IRA.

Because you have a first programming job without any college debt, you will be able to pump more money into savings that would otherwise go to paying off your college loans, so you'll have nearly four decades for your savings to compound until the age you retire. If you keep your savings rate high and your expenses low while earning a programmer's salary, [you could even retire decades earlier than usual](https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement). The early years of your career are very important for retirement, because the money you save then will have much more time to compound than if you start working towards financial independence later in life. Don't squander your success as a programmer by not living frugally. Remember, that's the whole reason you are self-taught instead of university educated, so that you can accomplish financial independence and live without any debt. For tips on living frugally, you can always read [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com) or most financial independence blogs and books.

Many jobs of the future will be programming jobs. By studying computer science now, whether you are young or old, you can find a job at or near your home town which will provide for you a comfortable life. Early retirement could be a goal, but frugality combined with cheap education provided by internet resources will allow you to flourish as a programmer so that thanks to your lifestyle choices you will obtain financial independence quick. Once you're financially independent, you can start exploring programming through a lens that you, not your employer, define, and use computer science towards goals that are yours alone. Programming is a powerful asset to have, and as a computer scientist you will be more likely to pursue your interests and ideas if you are financially independent. Using the resources outline in this post, coupled with this website and others like it that compile affordable online computer science education, you can get your first job programming with an investment of only hundreds of dollars instead of the tens of thousands of dollars that universities cost. By saving while young, earning compound gains in your early years, as opposed to paying compound interest in student loans, you can find the happy life that comes from refusing to go into debt (even for education). 

I'm not saying it will be all roses and sparkles. Being self-taught through your public library can be extremely grueling and demanding. You'll face distrust and even resentment. You're willingly removing yourself from the dog eat dog world of private universities and academia. You're placing your bets on the internet instead of academia as being the modern solution to computer scientist training, and if you're not familiar with the suite of apps and services out there you might not be willing to believe self-education is possible. That's why I created this website, to promote OER-literacy so programmers know what resources are at their disposal in their quest to become the world's greatest computer scientists. I fully believe that a public library will, in the future, be the place where you earn your bachelor's degree. In the moment, the services offered by a public library, if you're lucky in your hometown, are already sufficient for self-training in computer science. With public libraries offering Treehouse and Lynda, there are great and free resources for anyone with an internet connection that can provide a serious boost to someone's study of programming. Couple in OpenCourseWare, OER, Library Genesis, and a cheap PluralSight account, and you're set for years of study that can get you a first job. Utilize your job's tuition reimbursement and UoPeople and GT OMSCS and you'll find yourself in your thirties with a master's degree in computer science that cost you nothing at all. By matching your drive to work as hard as possible with a drive to invest in index funds as much as possible, you could set yourself up for FIRE'ing. I'm not saying your career as a computer scientist has to be short, but it's a nicer problem to have than to not have, right?


## #43 - You Don't Need to Spend a Cent to Learn Computer Science

There is a pretty simple fact in computer science education that most people, especially those in educational technology, try to smother out: You Don't Need to Spend a Cent to Learn Computer Science. I heard this line on a Mad FIentist podcast, where the guest explained through various financial independence blogs like Mr. Money Mustache (not to mention our [free index funds books repo](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-04-Free-Index-Funds-Books.html)), you could learn the basics of financial independence totally free. And I firmly believe that to be the case for computer science too. There are so many open source educational resources that anyone can learn to program for free.

Let's look at the specifics. If you learn better by reading, there is the [Holm School curriculum](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html) as well as the [EbookFoundation archive](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books) of free CS books. [Saylor Academy](https://learn.saylor.org/course/index.php?categoryid=9) creates OER-based CS classes. I recently saw Seattle Public Library has a subscription plan for Safari Books, which is ridiculously cool and I hope is mimicked by public libraries around the world. If your ethics are more vagabondic, you can find any published CS book for free on Library Genesis and use the curriculum laid out on [teachyourselfcs.com](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com), [functionalcs](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/), or on actual CS syllabi from top schools posted online. If you learn best by watching college lectures, there are compendiums of CS OpenCourseWare on github like [Developer-Y's](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses). If you learn best by video, your public library probably has a Lynda subscription, and if you're lucky (or you ask nicely) they might even have a Treehouse subscription plan for you. You can also rely on YouTube tutorials. If you learn well through MOOCs, there's always [edX](https://www.edx.org), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.com) plus curriculums like [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu) on github. That's not even including the various free tutorial websites which you can pick and choose from their free curricula, like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing), [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). Oh my god, and did I mention that you can just walk into your public library and check out hundreds of computer science and programming textbooks for free? If something isn't OER, the topic is probably covered multiple times over at your public library (it might not be the latest book, but when you're just beginning you don't need the most cutting edge language and older books suffice for learning the ropes of programming).

These are just a sample of all the resources available to teach yourself CS. There are so many it's almost overwhelming just to think about. And yet, that's almost the final word when it comes to open source education surrounding CS: You don't ever have to pay for it.

In my circumstance, my job requires some more domain-specific education concerning the particular stack I work on, so they willingly pay for my PluralSight account. It's roughly $200 a year for good, advanced tutorials related to C#, .NET Core, and Angular which is what I need. The free sites above were enough to get me knowledgable about the stack so that I could get hired, but at that point (my first internship) a paid intervention was necessary to get me up to snuff so that I could program in our stack. Even with those particular circumstances, I still just want to emphasize: What is necessary to train me for my advanced full stack development job is just $200 a year. That is chump change. I would pay for that even if it weren't reimbursed. When you add something like PluralSight ($200 a year) on top of that OER Stack listed above, plus maybe something like Library Genesis, you basically cover all your educational bases for $200 a year. There is no need for expensive college classes. There is no need for degrees or certificates. All you need is the effort required to self study advanced topics in programming in your free time, and you're absolutely covered with just $200 a year. Even a $4000 University of the People degree could basically fund TWENTY years of PluralSight. I'd rather have twenty years of PluralSight than a undergraduate CS degree. And that's for the cheapest CS bachelor's degree too. That's just how expensive degrees are, and I really honestly believe in this day and age, when you're able to just list out on your resume the years you've put into the OER websites above and can just list the tracks you've completed as well as the many programming languages you know, that not having a degree is not a barrier to your first programming job. You'll still have to self-educate for 2-4 years to match what your degree-owning competitors know, but when you show your competency as a result of your hard work reading CS OER books and programming open source software, you'll find that you can secure a programming job (especially with the low unemployability statistics as of recent, which is a hiree's market). The benefit is obviously that you won't have any debt, and can put that equivalent into your 401k and IRA's S&P500 or VTSAX index fund, possibly even maxing them out thanks to your advantage.

And just because you don't spend money on a degree doesn't mean you're banished to serfdom for the rest of your life. Most programming jobs carry rich benefits, which means you can get tuition reimbursement so that you can spend zero money on an actual bachelors degree from [UoPeople](https://www.uopeople.edu) as well as a master's degree through GATech [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). Since you will have already taught yourself programming, you'll breeze through these courses with hardly any effort and will earn your degrees for free thanks to your job's tuition reimbursement. Here's a good life tip: If your education isn't free, don't pay for it. Never go into debt for education in the day and age of the internet and the high demand for programmers. Most places that will "sell" you a CS education are probably a scam.

So I hope you can take in the programming landscape: ubiquitous free educational resources to launch your career as a programmer. Once you've got your first job, your "degrees" don't matter and it's all a matter of performance and competency. From there you can job hop as you learn how enterprise development happens, at which point you can land a high paying job after just a few years of junior positions and truly start maxing out your 401k and IRA in index funds as well as fuel an after-tax index investing account as detailed in [Tips for Personal Finance](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-09-Ending-Thoughts.html#tips-for-personal-finance/). You're set up for early financial independence if you mix index investing with a high savings rate fueled by practical frugality. Welcome to a stress free life!

I really want to thank all the eggheads behind the modern movement of open education. It is truly humbling to think that authors and writers put their sweat and tears behind an educational curriculum, AND THEN made it free online for anyone to study, just out of their kindness and belief that more programmers and more open source software will improve the world. Fortunately, their prophecy rang true and practically all software in the future will be open source. Open Source is now affecting college curriculum, not only to bring down some of the costs like textbooks, but also as a competitor in the educational marketplace (especially when we've reached the point that OER is catalogued so easily through various github repos that accessing it is painfree and immediate). For those edge cases were a degree might help, the responsible approach is to delay it until your job reimburses it, and ensure that the costs are completely covered by sticking with inexpensive, philanthropic online CS degrees like UoPeople and GATech OMSCS. It's a pretty simple plan, one that I hope to spread until it's common knowledge, because student debt is so damaging at age 22. That is the age you should be working to max out your savings and 401k and IRA, so it can compound for 40 years. Delaying that responsibility due to something as useless as student loans for a degree, if you're a computer scientist, is just wasted opportunity.

People think avoiding college debt through strategies like those listed on this website are "risky" and could possibly lead to a lifetime of suffering. What in the world would cause people to believe that being a self-taught programmer is a risk is just blatant ideological prejudices created by propaganda. To think that a self-taught programmer will be some sort of social cripple that can't ever communicate effectively or experience free thought and critical thinking is just weird as hell and signals some deep brainwashing in America. Considering most of the top tech firms at the moment were founded by college dropouts, I'm a little concerned that 18 year olds are going tens of thousands of dollars into debt just to satisfy their parent's fear that self taught programmers are nincompoops. Unforunately the only social ill I suffer from as a self taught programmer is the hopeless realization I'm going to be a millionaire at retirement because of my 70% savings rate in my early thirties thanks to my comfortable programming jobs. Sure, I don't have a programming degree from a prestigious university, so I might not work in Silicon Valley, but I live in a low cost of living city which just also happens to be my hometown so I'm with friends and family. If financial independence is something you would sacrifice in order to gloss your resume with a prestigious academic degree from a private university, I don't think you've studied financial independence enough.

I didn't need to go to university to learn programming, I was doing just fine reading C++ books from my public library, but going to a few years of my hometown public university did help me focus my studies in a positive way as well as leading to some very useful internships. For $8000 total and two years of hard work, I now am nearly financially independent after just a few years of working as a programmer and having a 50-70% savings rate. Fortunately I now am employed in my hometown, where I want to do most of my philanthropy, so I'm going to hunker down, stay frugal, and work my butt off while I'm young and earning those compounding gains in order to fuel a legacy of philanthropy in my hometown. Even if I'm "stunted" intellectually because I never experienced computer science at Harvard or whatever bullshit hedgefund institution passes for prestigious these days, I'm quite happy with the idea that I'm going to be able to donate millions of dollars to my hometown public library when I die. I don't know if being a self taught programmer means that I have poor social skills thanks to not interacting with a tier1 professor, but I'd like to think my "goals" in life are plenty 'social' and freethinking. It's quite a shame that our society views people without degrees as derelicts and social burdens. All while rich billionaires blow their possible philanthropic goals by donating billions to hedge fund schools like ivy league private universities with tens of billions of dollars in their endowment already instead of hitting their donations where they are much more useful, like community colleges. The money keeps flowing into these private universities, where public opinion keeps growing that private universities are the only goal worth having in life for non-flunkies/junkies. And people trying to mimick the prestige of those privates by going to expensive publics find themselves with tremendous debt too, forbidding their investing at an early age when it matters most. It's a tremendously wasteful system that lets universities thrive at the expense of real and naive students.

Open source is an ironic answer to the dilemma. In the day and age where former bastions of humanism, the university, are now Marxist and anti-Enlightenment shitholes, and former bastions of socialist theoretics, like free and open source software, are now fueling modern free market capitalism, the reversal is notable. This is a day and age of waning ideologies. Smoking is now more unpopular than ever, with a more widespread appreciation of the dangers of drinking biting quickly at its heel. Mental illnesses are being understood more clearly and correctly by the mass population rather than stigmatized out of existence and propriety. Meat eating and the standard American diet is increasingly understood as fueling heart disease and cancer, with many people abstaining due to health concerns rather than ethics as Whole Food Plant-Based diet researchers spread their findings through books and movies. There are many old world ideologies getting flushed down the toilet in this new world fueled by computers and the internet where rules are inverted from tradition and being replaced with the latest findings in science instead. At the helm of this is the possibility to fuel a very rewarding career in programming for free online thanks to computer scientists being at the forefront of open source technology. Given the stakes that are raised by extreme student loans and choosing job-prospect-less majors, it seems appropriate to teach about the ubiquitous free resources available to start a career in CS rather than paying tens of thousands of dollars for a major with no jobs at the end of the four years. Not to mention the fact that most well paying jobs in the future, no matter what field, will require programming skills as a prerequisite. Programming is the modern literacy, a non-negotiable skill that ought to be taught in gradeschool if modern educators truly understood what the future holds. I'm not a huge proponent of screen time for kids, but it's a Pascal's Wager when sacrificing some ideals enables such benefits. I taught myself to program in elementary school, and it opened worlds for me that continuously blow my mind in their reward. I don't think just a few self-motivated students should reap the rewards of modern markets and technology.

Is learning programming easy? No, it's quite hard emotionally and intellectually and requires quite a lot of start up capital to get your feet on the ground. But I think lowering the bars as much as possible is an important goal, and that's why as someone that catalogued art historical educational practices the past half century in my senior thesis now shifts my focus to computer science education as a historical artifact, I'm so thrilled about how the barriers to entry are now historically as low as they could ever be. Are all problems of access empty? NO. But do I think the only solution is to throw potential programmers into the meat grinder of university and let them sort out the problems afterwards of having $50,000 of nonbankruptable debt at the ripe age of 22 is a best practice? Hell no. There has to be an alternative, and that's why I promote unschooling/self-taught/'Holm Schooling' as a valid path to boot up your CS career. Is it easier to get a college degree? Of course it is, I'm not delusional. If you score a scholarship and can go to college to study CS somewhere, ANYWHERE for free, it is foolish not to endeavor on that noble task. I'd hope the goal of this Holm School project is to have more advanced dialogue on the subject than that. Yes, college is potentially awesome, no it is not worth tens of thousands of dollars when you can teach yourself at the public library and online for free. You're going to get your foot in the door of the programming industry if you're willing to do the work. I don't make guarantees, but from personal experience the barrier to entry is quite low even for a self taught programmer.

The way I think of it, you can pursue a [$5200 F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) if you are truly concerned about the necessity of a college degree in the modern jobscape and want to hedge your risk by pursuing something that's self taught but at least results in a piece of paper. That's fine with me, in fact I recommend what I did and just go to your local public university and take as many CS classes (only) as possible. That way, you're set up for life in some sense. There's the irony of then qualifying for jobs with tuition reimbursement when there are no classes or degrees to further pursue, but perhaps you just want a job worse than living non-ironically. I truly believe in the individual to make choices for themselves, and that I'm not here to preach or bellow about the One True Path for Success, and I look forward to being proven wrong many times in the future. Sometimes taking on debt seems justified. I wish you the best of luck if that is your choice to pursue. But in my case, I couldn't exceed a certain threshold of funds and as a result had to modify my goals to incorporate a large amount of free online learning in order to still cover my "CS bases" while not running out of funds. I think there are probably many other people faced with a similar dilemma, so I am cataloging my tactics here on this blog. There is hope if you can't afford college (even public university), and I truly believe that not being able to afford it should never be a hindrance to anyone who dreams of becoming a computer scientist. I found salvation particularly at my public library, and as such I consider the Topeka Public Library to be my alma mater. I received no degree nor certificate from any college in CS (not even an Associates), yet I was picked for my internship as well as my first job as a result of what I had taught myself at my public library. I think "self-taught" is a little deceptive as a word, especially when the result of my education was thanks to the efforts and good will of many educators who responded to the crazy potential that the internet afforded. So I call it "Holm Schooling," since even home schooled kids aren't thought of just teaching themself everything they know from thin air. Something has to be inclusive of the necessity of open source authors, and that's why I created "Holm Schooling" as an idea. This is possible only because of open source, philanthropic computer scientists. Thank you so much for the opportunity to flourish as a computer scientist debt-free. Thanks to that I maxed out my 401k and IRA and invested in 100% index funds thanks to the tactics outlined by [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com) and [JLCollins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/), and as such a life that was marred by mental illness and dim prospects for the future, approaching homelessness if I'm being honest, is now infinitely optimistic and rewarding. Glad I put my trust in open source ever since I discovered linux in ninth grade. A community that doesn't let you down or drown, as long as you're willing to take initiative yourself.

So let's follow this axiom in our time here at Holm School: You Don't Need to Spend a Cent to Learn Computer Science. It might require radical praxis and some crazy new rules to fulfill, but who's against radical praxis and crazy new rules!??! Debt blows, especially when you want to sock away money in index funds when you're young but you're stuck siphoning off your earnings. Let's avoid that icky feeling as much as possible and live our life on a second tenet: Avoid Debt as Much As Humanly Possible. Pay for everything in cash rather than credit (and that includes cars and university), and you'll safeguard yourself from having other financial obligations while you're young other than the goal of socking away as much cash as possible into tax-deferred index funds. Truly, the rewards of decades of compounding interest are enough to flabbergast even the most ardent anticapitalist and naysayer. Let's follow one more axiom: Your Youth is Dedicated to the Task of Saving As Much as Possible Into Index Funds. That one's a bit edgier, after all youth is precious and concerning yourself with FINANCIAL CONCERNS while young is just about as socially promoted as crack, but for us Holm Schoolers, it's an axiom. We're young and competent enough to be programmers, probably as a result of being able to read the future landscape of the global economy, and equally we're able to read the future landscape of our personal lives and put early extreme saving in tax-deferred accounts like an IRA or 401k as a priority. If you're saavy enough to teach yourself how to program software, you are saavy enough to follow the very comprehensible, non-rocket science steps that enable financial independence. Our Holm Schooled lives are marked by reponsibility and forethought, not spontaneity nor the immaturity of playing dumb and not heeding the insights of intelligent Cassandras. Humanism isn't a curseword but a virtual Theology, one we're willing to keep abreast of in all it's cutting edge manifestations in blogs and podcasts as well as studying the historical lineage too in the form of public domain books and archives cataloging its development. We're fueled by philanthropy and mission, not the easiest ticket to success and the good life no matter what the community cost.

That's probably enough waxing, but you get where I'm coming from in my belief that you don't need to spend a cent on learning to program. If you don't turn your nose up at the thought of an open source book, you're probably emotionally prepared to save some serious moolah in this quest to become a programmer. Good for you. Microsoft tarried for years besmirching the open source community, painting it as deplorable and deviant, and that philosophy just sort of seeped into enterprise. I don't hold resentment over that, though, and just sort of laugh about their lack of foresight at what now amounts to a queer historical footnote (Microsoft is now an open source company). But obviously now the same sort of besmirching is happening in academia, arguing that college is indispensable to capitalism and the sacrifice of having a degree is some amount like a million dollars in lifetime earnings. Fortunately that probably isn't the case in computer science, because it's not particularly difficult to learn what universities teach especially in the day and age they willingly post their CS lectures on YouTube. But is that out of willingness or a sort of capitulation to the open source education movement? Honestly, I can't get behind their minds nor know the motivations of schools, but I'm guessing it's not 100% goodwill and mission. Maybe I'm paranoid but the growing importance of programming and open source as it spreads like wildfire on the tallgrass of the internet has to be a bit disconcerting to the efforts of academia to raise tuition as much as economically possible each and every year. What obviously needs to happen is the application of Moore's Law to CS Education, to reify it electronically so that it grows exponentially, and I think we're just at the cusp of that happening thanks to recent inventions like YouTube. Are things perfect? No, there will always be sacrifices. But are students graduating from college, something as basic as a universal human right, debt free in a modern liberal democracy? No, and that's truly disconcerting. I have to admit that online education might just be the future, as much as I hope for a future place for the traditional academy funded properly to not require student loans as is implemented in Europe. You can bet I'll be caucusing next year for Joe Biden and his goal of funding free community college without dipping into the contradiction of socialism like other candidates.

This isn't a zero sum game where in order for open ed to succeed academies must be razed. There's basically a panoply of choice for future computer scientists, and in that educational market competitivity is healthy and part of what makes living in America great. Pick and choose from the rich buffet that is offered to computer scientists. Drink from the cornucopia of CS EdTech offering what amounts to debt-free career starters, and eat from the horn of plenty that results when you mix STEM jobs with FIRE personal finance goals. What fortune our future holds, both for ourselves and for humanity. If you aren't tickled by the future prospects for civilization as a direct result of having computer science flourishing as a discipline, I suggest you think deeply about what the good life means. But I doubt there are many out there who aren't optimistic, so the statement is more rhetorical than prescriptive. Let's laugh and feast about the great predicament that we find ourselves in: the problem of burdensome student debt in America by students interested in computers has been mitigated by the 'crisis response team' of open source computer scientists and authors. That's the way things are supposed to happen! We'd be fools to turn our backs on the team effort. Let's use what we've been given and 'Holm School' ourselves into a prosperous future. The social obligation to attend an ever-more-costly university is gone, to those in the know! Be in the know and laugh at those enormous debts that cost you a million+ dollars at retirement when compounded at age 22, when you are at the outset of your career and have no guarantees about your ability to pay them back. What a quaint historical note! Someday I'll tell my kids about this.

The future is now, the future is open source educational technology. Though you'll miss the drugged out and drunken Bacchanalia that passes for libertarian university socialization these days, you'll have spent those weeknights (lol) sober and studying FIRE personal finance and the latest programming frameworks, both free, in order to retire early in your own hometown, with your lifelong friends and family and absolutely no regrets if that's what you want. Don't feel forced to participate in a broken, antihumanist system that requires you leaving your hometown when still young and unemployed. [Know who your enemies are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihumanism) and be a discerning consumer. If you're not getting burnt alive at university, chances are someone you care about is. Not everything has to be politically fueled, though, and sometimes just rationally evaluating whether you want to go into debt at a young age for something you can learn at home free online or at your public library can be a guidestone for the tough decisions you'll be faced with making at 18. Some people, in my opinion, are addicted to academia, and the repercussions are as grave as drug use. I admit I consider myself in this category, up until I read [100rsns](http://100rsns.blogspot.com/) I still thought I'd get a liberal arts masters or PhD whenever I could afford it. Fortunately nothing prevents me from downloading art history books from Library Genesis and reading them on my ipad in my room after working as a programmer. A degree would be an ironic and costly signal of my naivity and addiction to prestige more than something which I could employ at work or in life. My name is Ryan, and I am an addict (to prestige). I struggle every day not to sign up for an OMSCS degree before my tuition reimbursement vestment kicks in, or to take more classes at my public university in CS even when I'm employed as a programmer. Maybe a quick MALS degree here or there, when I'm feeling low! Even me, of all people, who has a blog and a github organization dedicated to learning CS for free online, thinks I need more degrees behind my name. What a vicious cycle. I wish I had never tried my first academy.

Good luck in your crafting of your future. Being a scientist is truly rewarding and life changing. What a insightful decision you've made; what a good head you have on your shoulders. Let me share what I've learned, to add just a single voice to the deep sea of more keen voices of programmers and scientists who have FIRE'd. Compound interest, Open Source, and Computer Science -- What a combination!

Addendum: Just want to post a note about this Atlantic article: ["The Books of College Libraries Are Turning Into Wallpaper"](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/college-students-arent-checking-out-books/590305/)

## #42 - Fincel

**"fincel:**

**The financial version of an "incel" (involuntarily celibate, sexually frustrated). A typical fincel suffers from economic illiteracy, which results in poor career and life planning decisions that lead to a life of poor financial health. This financial dissatisfaction is often a combination of a college degree that is not marketable, large amounts of student debt, etc. Like incels, a fincel often turns to extremist political/social views that involve harming those that are economically literate and financially stable. Fincels resent society.**

**Jim: hey whatever happened to Tony? He was excited to graduate with an art history degree.**

**Scott: Tony lives at home still and works as an Uber driver and sometimes bar tends. He's evolved to a bitter fincel and hates successful people."**

-- Urban Dictionary

I came across this word a year ago on reddit and it really broke my heart when I looked at the Urban Dictionary page for it. I am obviously a fincel as a person that went to an expensive private college and graduated with an art history degree a few months before the Great Recession, where I was unemployed for five years before I decided to go back to my local college and take computer science classes (I did know how to program, just not OOP). You can imagine there are a lot of regrets in my life, such as taking on 'large amounts of student debt' for a 'college degree that is not marketable.' The funny part in my life is that I thought I would do well at college and become a professor of art history. Instead, I developed a mental illness that hindered my work ethic to such a degree that my professors refused to write recommendations to me to graduate school. That was actually a blessing in disguise, as going on to a graduate degree in art history would have been a ridiculously bad decision. I know now, after much research, that the future career path of a liberal arts PhD is not a professor job, but adjunct hell. It became obvious as I was unemployed that there was no purpose to pursuing a graduate degree. If I couldn't even get a job with an undergraduate degree, what was the point of spending more money on my education? Sure, you read that you could only get a job at a museum with a graduate degree or the only good paying art history jobs required a PhD, but I realized it was baloney because if even an undergraduate resulted in no jobs, then a graduate degree would result in the same thing.

As I researched the sociology of liberal arts higher education, I decided I wanted to spend my training as an art historian persuading people not to pursue an art history degree. Hence this website, where I take a critical view on getting a liberal arts degree, instead of just spending $4000 getting a UoPeople computer science degree and researching your liberal arts topic on the side as a hobby along with working as an IT professional or programmer. Even Wallace Stevens worked as an insurance person. I don't think working in STEM precludes success in the liberal arts, in fact, it enables you to possibly even retire early through FIRE techniques so that you could hypothetically spend the rest of your life studying the liberal arts, if that is your true passion. Like Cal Newport ("So Good They Can't Ignore You"), the idea would be to follow an easy career trajectory that enabled you to be FI early and then pursuing passions rather than following your passions and, ironically, ending up a fincel (which, I promise you, if you are not from an independently wealthy family that serves as a safety net/trust fund, is extremely probable if you spend a lot of money getting a liberal arts degree). The nice thing is that STEM degrees set you up for a life doing anything you want. STEM majors can teach and research the liberal arts just fine. It is exceedingly rare that a liberal arts major can teach and research the sciences. It is because the liberal arts should be a hobby, not a career, because professions (that pay YOU, instead of YOU paying someone else) simply don't exist in the liberal arts.

**"Art major huh? ill have fries with that LOL. im cool STEM guy im pumped to live in a world where knowledge of art & literature is punished"**

-- FYAD Superstar @BevisSimpson

The problem is that the liberal arts have become infected with the superstition and paranoia that anything related to the sciences is horrible. This is a bit of a simplification, but in my experience it is true (I worked in the STS Department of a school for two years and if you don't know what STS is, it's basically anti-science 'humanists' (i.e. anti-humanists)). The sciences are so intertwined with the arts that anyone who suggests otherwise (and oh my god, in your classes will you ever read 'theorists' who proclaim science is patriarchal/colonial/whatever) is ignorant about the humanities. Unfortunately, it seems focusing on writers ignorant of the humanities is and has been in vogue since the seventies. You can graduate with a liberal arts degree and take two classes of science your entire academic career. That is a shame, because the best art is an expression of the best science. The people who don't know this or are brainwashed otherwise are the people that purposely wall themselves off from anything economically logical in order to "viva la resistance" against the patriarchal/colonial/whatever sciences. To have the humanities be taught as being anti-science is a degradation of millennia of work and research in the arts and sciences. The arts and sciences are the same thing, there is no wall separating them. The result of the seventies generating liberal arts PhD that know nothing about science, in fact are anti-science, has resulted in college being a complete waste of money for anything other than the STEM. I would go so far as to say a STEM major, as taught at universities, IS a liberal arts degree. That's obvious to anyone whose STEM department is within the school of liberal arts, but I mean that in the sense that a STEM graduate can do the same level of research as anyone with a liberal arts degree. Because a "STEM" degree is a "liberal arts" degree. Unfortunately the reverse is not true, with the amount of science hysteria in liberal arts departments resulting in liberal arts majors that are not scientists in the least. This is why no one wants to hire liberal arts majors, because like the definition of fincels points out, they come out 'turned to extremist political/social views that involve harming those that are economically literate and financially stable.' The brainwashing in the liberal arts departments is decided anti-humanists, and anti-humanists are despised by anyone with economic literacy or good life planning decisions. Is anti-humanism a good life planning decision? No, being an anarchist in a circle of humanists might look cool in your teens, but once the real world steps in, which is decidedly pro-humanism (almost to the point of fanaticism), you're going to be ostracized. And if you don't turn your life around by getting some economic literacy, or career and life planning, you will face ostracism for your whole life. The only job you will find is a job in... duh... the liberal arts departments around America.

Because computer science is the most affordable degree in America with the highest return on investment, it is my opinion that anyone interested in the liberal arts should get a degree in CS from UoPeople and get employment either as a programmer or else in a liberal arts job if you can find one. Trust me, you won't be excluded from a liberal arts job because you have a CS degree, if you continue to follow the humanities as a hobby. Reading is the best skill in the world, and when you are reading science textbooks you are also studying liberal arts textbooks. Ergo, a cheap CS degree from UoPeople is the most strategic positioning for having a good humanities career, while also having the benefit of positioning you for a good computer science career if you choose. Having more options is better than having less, in my opinion, regarding university degrees and fields. Get your degree affordably then move on to doing what you want to do with your life. Stop caring so much about degrees that you'd willingly become anti-science just to position yourself to have more success as a liberal arts professor candidate. What a crappy cult to choose to become a fincel for "success" in academia.

Honestly, in reflection, one of my proudest moments is when I flunked out of all my art history classes, because my ideas were viewed as dangerous (one my professor asked that I be referred to the campus psychiatrist because my essays reflected a 'disturbed mind'). If being pro-science gets you diagnosed as a 'disturbed mind,' then my failure as an acadmic art historian is one of the best affirmations of my abilities as a humanist, liberal artist, and researcher/historian. Secular humanism has been my lifeline, my guiding light in the darkest of times, and I owe those brilliant men and women who challenged the status quo centuries and millennia ago and created civilization, freedom of expression, and free trade. It's nice I could read their books for a quarter at my local public library booktique in high school. I guess you could say I'm a historian of humanism, rather than a historian of art, if you need to understand my ideology and why I am anti-liberal arts degrees and pro self-education.

Self education is a bit of a new branch of humanism, ironically. For the trajectory of humanism a few centuries ago was establishing colleges and affordable education. I still feel this is the goal, which is why I discount academia as too expensive and anti-humanism, thus worth avoiding for the university (of free thought and expression) that is the internet. I am no happy that the internet is a better university than universities, but after getting a liberal arts degree I now understand why the academy is a joke, vampirically expensive, and a waste of time and money. It's because a coup happened in the seventies, and since then has been brigaded to the point that universities became anti-humanist and instead focused on "getting their own" at the student (and society's) expense. Nothing prevents exploitation, it seems, at university. You can't mandate that humanists be hired as professors. If anti-humanists can coup the university, they can and will do it. But obviously there is no economic support for it, and that's why liberal arts departments have to charge students so much.

Now the humanist university is on the internet. That might seem like a letdown to a few, but I actually view this as incredibly cool. Asynchronous socratic seminars might seem like heresy or folly, but asynchronous socratic seminars protect students from the authority figure that is the professor. By removing the authority of the professor, who in the seventies became a gatekeeper to freedom of expression and mandated anti-humanism conformity in anyone allowed to progress through the academy, the internet is actually continuing the centuries old goal of affordable, humanist education for everyone. It is silly to think that things can't happen in the intervening years to change the strategy. Because anti-humanists seem to thrive in the petri dish that is modern university, we have to do without the infrastructure of brick and mortar classrooms and instead rely on the infrastructure of networks. We are literally in an important moment in human civilization, where people will need to make the choice whether they want to keep funding this "gang of nihilists" in liberal arts departments or whether they will vote with their dollars and study online (for a couple dozen bucks a month) instead. If we stop condemning online learners with the stigma of the boomers against self-education and online learning, probably through a CONCERTED HUMANIST EFFORT TO EDUCATE THE MASSES ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO EDUCATE THE MASSES AFTER THE INVENTION OF COMPUTERS, we can succeed against the 'success' of anti-humanists. Fortunately, the last place anti-humanists can find real employment is in the university. Unfortunately, people still compete ferociously for these slim pickings. Until people realize that the university chews them up and spits them out, they will stop glamouring a professor as the best job in the world.

To anyone that makes web pages, the role of a professor is sort of a joke because you can educate so many more people through web pages than as a professor. That is what learning computer science teaches you, yet liberal art majors never learn to program and thus never learn that the best 'professor' job is writing code, not living the cush life of a tenured professor. Until we promote computational literacy as a foundation of modern education, and show that the internet IS the best university, people will still pursue the goal of becoming a professor. It's such a shame when someone dampers their free thought and critical thinking just for a better stab at the last piece of the pie that is liberal arts tenure, rather than saving their money and learning to code and fueling a career that can sustain any lifestyle imaginable. 

My point in this is that if you are ignorant of how to study online in such a way that you receive a university-level education, it is worth researching self-education in this technological age. You'll find that the internet can bestow a good life rather than obligating tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. People centuries ago established universities as a place to educate people in the humanities and sciences regardless of wealth or class level. That dream is still alive, despite what you read about modern universities, because the internet is a university. The best university in the world, at the moment. While "The Internet" will never be #1 in the US News rankings, trust me that it is the best university in the world. You can read archives of books for free on Archive.org. Every science book ever written is on LibGen. Perlego aims to be a legal Spotify for Textbooks. Once people stop thinking the only respectable educational path is GOING TO UNIVERSITY, READING PAPER BOOKS IN A UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, and GETTING PLENTY OF SOCRATIC SEMINARS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A PROFESSOR, the more we can move on from this mess that is the student debt crisis and build a future that is more egalitarian and perpetuate education to those that don't already have it available, rather than promoting an elite system that is unscalable, exploitative of youth, and impossible to ship overseas. Once books are digitized and as affordable as a Spotify subscription, it will be obvious that anyone can learn anything they want (legally) online. This weird limbo state where self-educating online is illegal because you have to use LibGen needs to be gone as soon as humanly possible. It's an important transitional period, one as real-world impacting as the Napster wars, but once people (publishers) realize that things have changed because of the internet, we can move on as a society. There is no reason why in 2020 every book ever written shouldn't be immediately available on my ipad for a $15 subscription fee. The procrastination and pussyfooting we have from the publishing guild is a big reason why millennials are getting screwed by intergenerational conflict and yuppies who are so defensive of their luxurious turf. We know the internet is the solution to the problems faced by millennials, yet the yuppie generation uses copyright and laws to prevent any solution to our generation's problems. They will move on from college tuition and copyright law over their cold dead hands.

Whatever, I don't really expect much more from the generation that chewed up the environment and planet and instituted the most inefficient organization of society possible. They obviously, for all their college degrees, know nothing about science or civilization. That's my point, that all you have to do is look to professors and the yuppie generation to see that college educations are not only worthless, they actually create an entire generation of people that are narcissistic and nihilist and don't give a damn about future generations. That's what liberal arts departments have done to America since the seventies. Absolutely resulted in some of the worst critical thinking possible. If you want a reason to look to the internet for an education rather than colleges, just look at the generation that got a free college degree and ran with it. They have spoiled nearly everything they have touched. We millennials are doing the disaster recovery, and will be doing it for a good many years until they age out of their positions of power. Generation after future generation will have to prioritize disaster recovery for a single generation of people. The reason they are the way they are is because of their university education. Rather than bemoaning the replacement of brick and mortar universities with the internet, it should be seen as the best recourse for the problems we find ourselves in today. May another generation never do to the world what the previous generation has done.

If you are not familiar with humanism and are entering college age, I suggest you take a little time out of your life and acquaint yourself with some of the seminal texts. This is a great ballast to the waves of anti-humanism you will face when you enter college (if you choose to enter college). Don't drink the kool aid, don't become a fincel that hates science and refuses any job that isn't strictly academia, and don't go into debt to learn what you could learn reading public domain texts for free on your ipad. Reading is cool, but not that cool. Debt is a lot less cool than reading. The nice thing is, reading isn't contingent on debt, you can [still read the same great books curriculum](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-06-Humanities-Curriculum.html) regardless of giving some 'academic authority'/credentialing service your money. Don't need to pay anybody anything to go to your public library. Humanities, given that it's public domain, is something to pursue as a hobby to your STEM degree, not something to pay for in hopes that by going into debt people will pay you money to read public domain books. They won't. Sorry! You need to work as a programmer or scientist in today's society and pursue the humanities as a hobby.


## #41 - What it Means to Pay for College in Cash

I have a hypothesis: College is only worth paying for in cash. That is to say, never take out a loan to pay for college. Especially for a computer science degree. You can enforce this in a number of ways: Self-study for free through the internet using the open education resources listed on the [curriculum](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html) page, or otherwise going to community college to study computer science/programming (and not taking other classes in other departments). You could also enroll at University of the People and pay for college in cash by working five hours per week and living at home for four years while you complete the degree. Ditto for the community college option, if one is located in your hometown. Stay frugal and pay in cash.

This is partly a critique of student loan debt crisis. No college is worth going into debt for, because college isn't that important of a process anymore. Considering you are working on a computer anyway while learning to code, it would make sense to just open up free OER resources on the same computer and study that way, instead of paying for expensive lectures. Equivalent lectures have also been recorded and uploaded to YouTube in the form of Open Courseware. You can completely self study now a degree in computer science (especially if you include resources offered by your public library), there is no reason to pay for it. The secret is: You don't learn anything that you couldn't learn through self-study in the classroom. If you commit yourself to reading the same books, watching equivalent opencourseware lectures, then you'll be sure to come out with an equivalent education for free. If you are concerned about not having a degree, you can get one for $4000 through University of the People. Supplement UofPeople with extensive self-study and as long as you work your butt off every day for four years, you'll wind up with the same education. Coding isn't something that requires a classroom to learn. At a minimum, you could probably learn to code just through YouTube. Then combine that with the resources available at your public library, UofPeople, free OER, Library Genesis, MOOC providers like EdX and Coursera, plus all the OpenCourseWare that's been uploaded, and you are definitely able to advance quickly for free through the internet. Perhaps you even include on top of that a subscription to Treehouse ($300/yr) or PluralSight ($200/yr) and you'll have many lifetimes of video tutorials to get you moving right along with programming. I really can't emphasize that if you know what you're doing regarding self-study of computer science online (what this website hopes to teach), it's almost impossible to come to a different conclusion than free self-study instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars going to a brick and mortar university, with all the overhead that entails.

If you want to go into debt to study computer science, the options are clear: You could either spend tens of thousands of dollars for a single year at university, or you could use that ten thousand dollars and pay for a PluralSight account for fifty years. Would you rather go to one year of school or get fifty years of PluralSight? Considering the wealth of programming tutorials available on PluralSight, you would be quite satisfied with the conclusion of going with fifty years (an entire lifetime) of PluralSight for the equivalent of _one_ year of college. And the plus side of going with PluralSight is that you can amortize the cost and just work a few hours a year to pay for it along the way, versus going into debt (with the concomitant interest charges). Pay for your education in cash! Never take out a loan, especially in this day and age of internet self study!

Studying computer science will provide you with a job after the necessary study. You have to study a number of languages, a number of frameworks, read many books, and complete a lot of small programs and test sites. You won't get a job just because you have a degree. So why pay for a degree when you can ensure your success as a programmer by studying computer science online for free? Considering you can get a degree for $4000 through UofPeople, there's no reason not to go with the cheapest online degree, especially since most of your work will be on the computer anyway. The important thing is the number of hours you put into self-study in your quest to learn multiple languages and frameworks, not the acquisition of a degree after four years. Considering classes is only one tactic of accomplishing the goal of learning frameworks and computer science principles, you should do some serious cost-benefit analysis when you weigh the cost of a single class versus the number of years of internet study that single class could supply. Often time you'll find the affordability of internet study guarantees that you'll decide your money is better spent studying online versus paying for a brick and mortar college. If you reach this conclusion, as I have, you'll find that you can skip the private universities and self study and still come out with the knowledge needed to acquire a job. As a plus, because you chose frugality versus an over-hyped luxury product, you'll not be in debt nor paying interest on a loan!

If you make a promise to only pay for your study of computer science in cash, a real possibility if you study all the possible free study resources cataloged on this website, you'll find that at the end of four years, depending on how hard you work, you'll be job ready without tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Perhaps you'll even have a CS degree from UofPeople if you could budget for $4000. You'll find that once you start working, you're still obligated to continue studying computer science using the free resources you are now an expert in. So whereas all your colleagues of work the same age as you will be struggling with the learning curve of learning how to study outside of university classrooms, you'll already be a pro and you can keep studying without a single break in the flow of things. Knowing how to study frugally, for free or perhaps $300/yr for a Treehouse or PluralSight account, is a lifelong skill to acquire. The earlier you learn frugal computer science, the more you'll save as you accomplish your learning goals while avoiding debt. Many people never learn these meta-education skills, and are forever entering the loop of relying on brick and mortar universities for their skills acquisition. The degrees they earn are small pittance for the amount of debt they rack up. For some reason, this reckless behavior is seen as respectable in our culture. But once you learn how to program for free, you'll never again see the point in taking out a loan to learn what you can learn for free through the public library. See the recklessness in taking out a loan for something as self-driven as education, and you'll put more emphasis on self study instead of institutional study, considering self-study is the only thing that gets the work done. You're reliant on self-study, so why not skip the interloper (college which costs an arm and a leg) and self-study for free instead of paying for a silly degree?

Unfortunately, the modern college operates on the culture-wide misunderstanding that classrooms are the best method of learning. This simply isn't the case. Video education in computer science is available for $200/year and it is simply amazing. You can pay for fifty years of video education for the cost of a single year of public university. What do you think is the better deal? You won't go in debt, you won't be accumulating interest charges, and you'll be self-sufficient in the skills necessary to be a lifelong computer science learner. If you can cope with the blow to your self esteem that comes from having a degree from "University of the People" instead of "Stanford", then you can compensate with not having a hundred thousand dollars of debt when you're twenty two. Perhaps you can even land a job and begin the steps towards financial independence, putting $18,500 in your retirement 401k from the ages of 22-32, and having enough in your 401k retirement at 32 to begin seeding private investment in Vanguard VTSAX index funds from age 32 to 45 so that you have enough saved up in Vanguard and your 401k to retire and live off the principal accruing in your Vanguard account from ages 45-60, when you can begin withdrawing from your retirement account. Those are some of the possibilities available to people working in the tech sector if they aren't saddled with a ton of debt from college. Instead of spending years paying off interest plus the student loan principal, you're instead accumulating interest in your favor in a retirement fund from a young age, which will enable you to live prosperously at age 60 when you can finally withdraw funds.

All this is possible without going into debt. You should never take out a loan for a computer science education, when so much of the curriculum is available free online. Self-study is the name of the game in computer science education, not the accumulation of degrees. Degrees cost tens of thousands of dollars, while learning how to program and do the duties required for a job costs about $200/year. While studying at your public library won't earn your any prestige, you can still learn the same amount regarding computer science than what you learn acquiring a degree. If you can live without prestige (especially when you weigh its benefits, like financial independence/early retirement), then you'll find that paying in cash for your CS studies is the best option when your goal is to avoid debt.

Of course, this argument might be a moot point for you. Perhaps you don't have enough money to pay for college anyway (and perhaps you're keen enough not to take out a loan on something as expensive as brick and mortar tuition). Perhaps online study, even study at the public library on public computers, is your only option. At which point I can definitely say don't think that you should attempt to somehow come up with the funds necessary for a college education, and instead get to work on online self-study at your public library. Here "cash" isn't just a way to safely guard your money against student debt crisis, "cash" is literally the means by which you plan on learning computer science outside of the university. To which I say, you can succeed in computer science for free if you use OER, Library Genesis, MOOCs/OCW, public library CS stacks, and YouTube. That's the free option; kick in a couple hundred of dollars a year and you can use online video resources like PluralSight or Treehouse. Bonus if Lynda or Treehouse is provided by your public library (be sure to recommend it to them!). Learning to program for $200 a year is a great deal, and the success of computer science to diffuse via the cheaply accessible means of the internet is a huge accomplishment for the future of humanity. Kids will be able to learn to program for free as long as they understand english, have the internet, and have a Raspberry Pi. As years go by, those things will become more and more affordable and accessible. If you truly survey the resources available for beginner programmers on the internet, you'll come to the conclusion that university is a rip-off when it costs $1000 a class, when you could buy PluralSight for five years for the cost of one university class. There is a lifetime of learning available in OER CS books. MIT OpenCourseware provides access to great classes and lectures, not to mention archives of many other school's attempts at Open Courseware, all on YouTube. I'm at the point where I can't even keep up with Treehouse's new courses (which I get for free through my public library), so I barely even use PluralSight, Lynda, or Library Genesis textbooks. Just one free resource keeps me learning after work year after year, learning new frameworks and languages. Think about how redundant these mega online curriculums will be in a few years when there are many options, all for affordable prices! I already have more free resources to learn programming than I currently have time to work through. I'd love to study more open courseware lectures and read more CS textbooks from Library Genesis, but by the time I'm done studying Treehouse after work it's time to go to bed! All of this costs me $200 a year (for a PluralSight account, which I don't even use and could cut out for budgeting reasons). Free computer science education has exploded in recent years, and it will continue to explode as computer science becomes more and more important to the economy and not-year invented technology. It's a very fun time to be a programmer. There are hundreds of options for when you want to study computer science, and all of them are free! If you are willing to forgo the cut to your prestige and avoid paying thousands of dollars for brick and mortar university tuition, then you stand to save a lot of money while not sacrificing anything towards your education.

If you are interested in being a computer scientist, then there is no better use of time than studying the way your public library and open educational resources can be used to promote your studies in CS. I get Lynda and Treehouse for free through my public library. Library Genesis is an international public library for science textbooks. I throw in a PluralSight account for $200 a year, and I'm fulfilled for all my personal studies. When I am motivated and want a break from that action, I peck away at aGupieWare's list of CS open courseware playlists on YouTube. I read the textbook for the course free on my ipad, thanks to Library Genesis. Next year I'm not renewing my account with PluralSight (perhaps I will get it free through my work), so my effective budget for e-learning is the cost of my internet ($45/month). I build test projects and host them on github, where I can test out the software and programming language. None of this costs me any money. I use the laptop provided by my work, and otherwise use a Raspberry Pi or a $400 Mac Mini at home (I have not needed to use either of these computers for two years because I use my work computer for studying after hours). My resume is expanding as I learn new programming languages, and I am accruing experience years by studying while working instead of taking time off and studying in a university. Degrees might expand your earning potential, but so does the number of years of experience you have, and ultimately I am banking on experience years as paying off more than degrees towards my earned salary. I am only working in jobs that offer tuition reimbursement, so I can finish my CS degree at University of the People for roughly a thousand dollars, followed by a Master's at Georgia Tech OMSCS for roughly a couple of thousand of dollars. That way I accumulate experience and degrees, but a fraction of the tuition is paid for by my employer. I am choosing the cheapest online degrees, which means I won't be paying a lot of money out of pocket. Perhaps I'll even wait it out, and continue studying with the free resources provided by my public library and hope that there will eventually be an online CS degree program that is even cheaper than OMSCS and UofPeople. Regardless, I am able to use my free time reading free books from Library Genesis and coding free at Lynda and Treehouse thanks to my public library. I can learn at PluralSight for $17 a month, and I can get tuition reimbursement through my job so I can earn CS degrees for hundreds of dollars instead of tens of thousands of dollars. All of this is possible because I bought the 9th Edition of Liang's Introduction to Java Programming book for $15 off Amazon, and read every chapter and did every single exercise problem (from scratch) at the end of every chapter. My intense self-study of Liang's textbook for a single year enabled me to be proficient and educated in computer science enough to fuel years of self-study using my public library's resources, Library Genesis, and open educational resources. I used an eight year old laptop that I got for free and installed Debian on it.

I now program for a job and save 50% of my aftertax pay, maximizing my 401k contributions ($18,500) and IRA contributions ($5,500) each year to get my retirement paid for while I'm still young and can accrue compounding gains. I live frugally and eat a vegan diet of lentils, oatmeal, pinto beans, brown rice, potatoes, peanut butter, and bulk soy protein powder, effectively bringing my grocery bills down to slightly more than a hundred a month. I have gone from being broke and resourceless (but not in debt) to a strong potential for financial independence, or at least a better quality of life than I had when I was broke. I will say that I have been programming since sixth grade and making web pages since seventh grade, so my learning curve for computer science was very easy to overcome once I started studying at university. But I really love computer science and the only reason I didn't major in it in college was that my college didn't have a computer science department! But self-studying through a myriad of resources, including some classes at the public college in my hometown (totaling $8000), gave me the knowledge necessary to acquire a first programming job with really good benefits, allowing me to continue studying computer science in my free time. I'm on my way to a new career four years after I started involved study, and my quality of life has improved greatly. So far I've spent about $9000 on studying CS (by using free resources from my public library matched with eight CS-only classes at my hometown public uni). That was four years ago, and I was lucky to get Lynda and Treehouse free through my public library after year one, but today with UofPeople, I think I could accomplish the same for around $5000. Or, as this website catalogs, for mere hundreds of dollars if you think you can forgo the CS degree altogether. All paid in cash, of course, with zero loans or interest payments. If you aren't paying cash for your CS degree, you are using the wrong resources for education!

The internet sometimes seems like magic, but if you spend the time studying open education, you'll find that it's not magic, it's just the effort of a dedicated educational community using open source licenses, sometimes relying on institutions like public universities or public libraries to supplement themselves, and using free hosting resources like YouTube or Github. Library Genesis is a gift of mana from the gods unlike any other invention of the past century. A quality education is now available for free in computer science thanks to the dedication of Library Genesis. Sometimes you can afford to be a little amazed by what web developers are able to create when they work as a community towards improving educational resources for people around the world. Give in to the magic. The future lies in open education on the internet, not brick and mortar university classrooms which cost too much.

Manage your career aggressively. Take responsibility for your own education and progress. Sometimes you have to adjust the parameters based on what you can afford. My hope in this website is to teach you how to maximize quality education with the most affordable costs, sometimes balanced to cost nothing at all. Sometimes working and gaining experience is more important than earning a degree. Sometimes you can meld these two constraints together and progress in your education while also working, at a low cost to you. By studying hard so you can acquire those jobs with good benefits like tuition reimbursement, you manage your career aggressively by ensuring you know all those interview questions and know the stack/programming language of your potential employer. Managing your career aggressively is the same as managing your education aggressively. In my particular case, because I was broke (but not in debt), I maximized affordability which meant relying on the internet and my public library. Sure, I guess I missed out on going to Stanford or whatever, but personally I don't care because I'm not a hundred thousand dollars in debt, while working the same job in the industry I want to be in. I like this option more than the college degree option. Your public library (and Library Genesis, etc.), as I repeatedly emphasize, is your ally in all of this, and by using your public library you can really maximize the affordability of learning to program. If you are aggressive in your frugality, and make demands like never taking out a loan for CS education, you'll reap the rewards that are possible with a career in computer science, such as financial independence/early retirement. But even if I can't FIRE, I'm still happy with the quality of life that I can sustain now because I taught myself to program on a TRS-80 (now you would do the equivalent on a Raspberry Pi) when I was eleven. Enjoy the fruits of your intense self-study. Don't believe the siren's call that self-study has to be expensive. Use old computers matched with Debian Linux, use free open educational resources, and use your public library. Self-study can be extremely intense for levels approaching free, and the money you'll save will "compound" for you because you'll be able to afford studying CS for longer amounts of time, allowing you to study more advanced topics which will earn you jobs that pay more. I want to emphasize how going to an ivy league school or Stanford or something is pretty cool, but teaching yourself computer science for $5000 in your hometown is also really cool in that sort of hacker way that some rare people come to appreciate (also called unschooling). I don't personally care which path your choose, I have no skin in the game, I only know that I really appreciate the path that I chose (the $9000 hometown path) which was possible due to some really smart and dedicated people on the internet and at my hometown public uni and public library, so I am writing about that path on my blog in case any one else is interested in the details. I think many will be, because student debt is so extremely unattractive and dangerous. I think many will be because that path, in this day and age, can be accomplished for mere hundreds of dollars.

Never be baited into believing education should cost money. For some reason, people believe that if they put money into their education, they'll receive a superior product. Unfortunately tutorials are the same whether free or proprietary, and there are a zillion free tutorials in computer science, so if you pay for education just know that you are paying for someone else's salary instead of putting that money into your own. With research, you'll find ways of finding free and open education on the internet that is the exact same quality as that which you would pay tens of thousands of dollars for at university. The deciding factor is your motivation to self-study, and once that is finalized by the intrinsically motivating factors like saving money and not being in debt, possibly leading to financial independence/early retirement, free online education will be your favorite new thing. It's quite amazing, truly, what is possible through the internet and resources like Google and Github. What used to cost tens of thousands of dollars at brick and mortar university are just lying around free on the street for anyone to pick up. If you are unaware of these progresses in cybereducation, you risk relying on the older model of education which hopes to maximize _their_ profits off your ignorance. By dedicating a few days to learning about OER through this blog, you'll find that this new model of open education hopes to maximize _your_ profits. Liberal democracy is an amazing thing, and the technology it has created is "eating" the old model of university and replacing it with a completely free model called open education. You make some sacrifices, (you don't get to live in a dorm that looks like a castle, with a luxurious meal plan with cooks that will prepare food for you) but ultimately you gain financial independence at a much faster rate without those pesky student loans. It is a sacrifice I am willing to take, and one that I took and am now living more than comfortably. If my arguments and anecdotes are successful, I hope others will also jump on board open education and avoid student debt crisis. I'd rather your money be accruing gains at a young age, not accruing interest. Live and self-educate frugally and you'll be better positioned for a rewarding career that lets you thrive as an engineer while maximizing your savings so that you can become financially independent (when your gains accrued off your low-expense index funds exceeds your yearly costs of living, and you are no longer reliant on a job). This sort of accomplishment can only be achieved through frugality and extreme saving. I don't see why frugality shouldn't be extended to computer science education, especially when there are quality alternatives for free. As with any frugality, there are costs to your choice to be frugal, but in my opinion those costs are negligible ("oh no, you don't have a CS degree from a prestigious private university! oh no, you don't have a fancy make of car! oh no, you don't wear designer clothes!") which really don't account for anything in real life.

This isn't a get rich scheme I'm coming up with and trying to sell off for personal profit. I'm just making sure that people are aware of the alternatives to university education, so they don't find themselves head over heels in lifelong debt after just four years of late-teenage life. Kids should know the repercussions of going into debt, especially for something as ubiquitously free and online as computer science education is in 2018. Technology has advanced so quickly that college-level education in CS are available online for free or perhaps just a couple hundred dollars a year. Enjoy the fruits of people's labor and self-educate from the online non-profit commons created by thousands of people for your personal gain. There's no scheme, no trick, just ubiquitous free CS books (and minor benefits like a UofPeople CS degree for $4000 total or a master's with Georgia Tech's OMSCS for $7000) which you can study on a Raspberry Pi for the cost of internet, after four years of hard work you'll be able to get a job. It's not magic, it's the power of self-study and unschooling, with a little help from open source licenses. Traditional brick and mortar college for computer science is over! Done! Deprecated! Replaced! Negligible!

## #40 - Computers are Colleges

Have you heard of my school? I go to Apple MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) University. Perhaps you've heard the school of my associate degree, Raspberry Pi Community College? It cost $50. The fact is, in modern times you could write down the model of your computer as your schooling on your resume. Computers are colleges. The things you can learn at university you can learn on your computer for free. There is nothing that prevents you from taking on an university course load using open educational resources that only require a Raspberry Pi and internet. A lot of people wonder what the point of the internet is? I would say the point of the internet (and the entire infrastructure surrounding computers we've built as a civilization) is to deliver college for free. There was a product -- college -- and a demand: cheaper college. The solution was to invent the internet. Going to college in the day and age of high speed internet is a lot like buying an antique model of car. The prestige is in driving around in an antique vehicle. Perhaps you get to participate in a car parade or car show with your old make of car that's still in pristine condition. But antique cars aren't anything but a hobby. They aren't convenient (in fact you'll pay exponentially greater expenses to maintain and repair it compared to a modern car) and the price you pay for the luxury of joining the small clique of antique car owners is paid for in your wallet. You can't take antique cars on a cross-country trip. Their functionality is limited in modern society with modern needs. A college degree is like an antique car because you get a special license, but ultimately the struggle you're signing your life away for is to fight against devaluation as much as possible by pumping costly renovations into it like continuously putting new paint jobs onto it and buying new parts. College, in the day of the internet, is a forty-year old car: nostalgically impressive if you're rich enough to maintain it, but ultimately an expensive hobby when evaluated as a modern utility. Buy a modern (electric) car: open educational resources. The conversion of internal combustion engines to electric cars is very similar to the transition from expensive colleges to free and affordable online post-secondary education.  If you have an interest in antique cars and have the money, then go for it. No one can deny your hobby. But if you are looking for a modern mode of transportation, then buying a cheap electric car is a much better investment. Same with self-study using open education, instead of risking student debt crisis.

If you come to see computers as a university education in a 24 square inch box, then you'll come to appreciate the view I have that university has been surpassed by online learning. I just don't believe that it is cheaper, I actually believe it is superior. That'll be a hard sell for most people, to believe that you can get a better online education than you can get from a brick and mortar university. But just look at the fact that in a few years every book ever written will be available for $15/month a la Spotify. The entire advantage that university has, with their academic library and syllabi of required reading, can be accomplished by anyone for $180 a year. The public library has interlibrary loans which allows you access to nearly any textbook ever written concerning computer science. This stuff gets learning done for free. There is zero cost associated with reading (electronic) books nowadays or interlibrary loans. If you are paying for books, stop! There is a more frugal way. At the point in which a university library is no longer an asset because every book available in its computer science stacks is available for free online, there isn't much of a reason to pay tuition for access to it. It sort of becomes redundant. In fact, paper books are even more of an annoyance that digital books, because paper books are heavy and burdensome while your ipad is one pound total for tens of thousands of pdfs and epubs. Everything materially advantageous about a university is being replicated inside of a computer. Everything that makes learning successful at a university is being ported over to computers. That's why I believe computers are colleges, and in the future it will make sense to say you studied at your public library on your laptop instead of putting down a university for your degree.

I think there need to be room for people who live in poverty to make hybrid resumes where their education is a bit community/public colleges, part public library, and part open education. The notion that you have to have a traditional degree is going to lose favor when people succeed at programming through their online educations. Most adults simply don't know about open source software, and they don't know that there are open source textbooks. People don't know that you can earn a b.s. in CS for $4k through UoPeople, or a master's in CS for $7k through Georgia Tech OMSCS. A lot of people think that if they don't get a traditional degree they will miss out on life. But life isn't a diploma. Life is being frugal when you are impoverished and not going into debt by paying for things you can't afford through credit. Life is relying on social services when you are in need, and not thinking that you're too important to turn down charity like UoPeople or MOOCs/OpenCourseWare/OpenEd because you deserve regional accreditation. It's not glamorous to admit that you can't afford college. In fact, it's downright angering. Other kids go to school without a sweat. Why can't you go to school? But you can go to school. It's called an internet-connected Raspberry Pi. You can learn to program for $50 and the cost of internet. I made this website so you can see that you can read great computer science textbooks for free. The reading list doesn't even include books or CS programming tutorials through sites like Lynda found at your local public library. Your college is your computer. Everything you need to learn to become a computer scientist can be learned through your computer. People who manufacture computers and websites and networks have built for you a modern college. Just because it doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars, or participate in an antiquated accreditation system, doesn't mean that it isn't a worthy academic institution. Your Raspberry Pi is a library, a classroom, a study hall, a conference room, a professor's office, a lecture hall, and a local hangout. I know it's not as glamorous as the life depicted of students in movies and books, but the inarguable fact is that it is free. Perhaps this appeals to your sense of frugality, or perhaps it appeals to the facts of your economic circumstances. But if you see your Raspberry Pi as a university, you will be able to appreciate all that it offers if you work and study hard through it. A lot of people act like they're hopeless when it comes to college, and that they're forced to attend college even though they can't afford it and they act angered that college isn't cheaper. But holy hell, haven't any of these people heard of Open Educational Resources? College is cheaper, it's practically free through your computer. I think it's very unfortunate that people are stuck with non-forgivable debt because of college, and it's a lot like gambling, but I hate the approach that says Americans are hopeless. If people study how to study online, they'll learn that there is ample OER for all levels of undergraduate study. Books can be acquired through interlibrary loans. The idea that we're all hopeless to exorbitant tuition prices acts as if computers were never invented. Those people want to act like bricks and mortar colleges are the future, when in fact they won't be much of a player in future life. The educated youth in the future will acquire their knowledge through open educational resources, and studying online for free instead of going to colleges they can't afford will be extremely sensible given how extensive OER will be in a decade's time. When the Spotify for books is invented (and licensing hammered out), there will be a significant interest in online learning versus traditional colleges.

I know technophilia is inexcusable, but the jobs of the future will be delegated out to programmers and computer scientists quite a lot. At least they have a central role. Most physical phenomenon in the world will be taken into the digital realm, where programmers become the engineers of the future. The public library contains all the resources you need to learn to program, and the Raspberry Pi allows you to build a satellite public library in your room for $50 and the cost of internet. The days of paying for college, living in a different city, and buying expensive textbooks is over. Thank god. I was able to become a programmer for $8000 thanks to resources available at my public library and public university. I have since discovered that because of OER I could practically learn what I studied for next to nothing. Fortunately it was only $8k, so I don't have significant buyer's remorse. But I will promote the free education available through open ed because I believe that it is the future, and I like to be an early adopter of futuristic technology (especially when it's free). I have made this website to compile the work of many computer scientists who have created free curriculum and compendium of OpenCourseWare so that you can get a high quality education for free. Don't ever feel embarrassed that you study online. The social stigma of online learning is fierce, but the people who make fun of you will be seen as fools in the future. When people ask where you went to college and you reply that you went to Raspberry Pi Community College for $50, there should be no stigma. Nothing is wrong with being impoverished. Being an impoverished computer scientist isn't reason for ostracism, though with the culture of programming people fear that it will be. Many in Hollywood want to depict computer science as a non-stop party of luxury, but that's not the reality that I've found. I found people accepting of my lack of a CS degree. My sister always points barbs at me and says that computer scientists are privileged, but being a working class scientist is much more possible than it ever was because of OER. If you need inspiration, just take a look at the list of OER CS books at [EBookFoundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books). All those books are free because the author wanted working class kids to be able to read their books and learn computer science through them. Computer Scientists invented open source licensing so that books could be published for free through the internet and still protect the rights of authors. Authors aren't benefitting from open sourcing their books, they're doing it because they know that impoverished students can't afford textbooks. Just take a look at the long list of OER on that page, and take comfort that computer scientists around the world care about working class computer scientists. Open source software allows for you to become a scientist for as close to free as possible. Scientists benefit when there are more scientists in the world. It's not a zero-sum game. Open source was invented so that your computer could become a college for you. Open source was invented so you could become a scientist even if you are impoverished. Scientists want you to become a scientist. That's why they release their books in open source format. If you don't believe me, just take a look at the number of [free science books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-science-books/blob/master/free-science-books) compared to the list of [free computer science books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books). All those books were released on the explicit mission that they get in the hands of impoverished people. That's the whole reason OER exists. You should be proud you are a computer scientist and part of the open source CS community. This is a community I've been a member of since I taught myself Red Hat in ninth grade, and it's never let me down (and my worst moments were when I turned my back to them and played with proprietary software). You should be proud to be a student at the Raspberry Pi Community College, which costs $50 total. The instructors and staff really care about you.


## #39 - Perlego is Now Available in the United States

[https://www.perlego.com](https://www.perlego.com)

After a year-long wait, Perlego is now available in the United States! If you're not familiar with Perlego, it is basically a "Spotify for Books" (although their primary focus is on textbooks). The cost is $12 a month if you buy the yearly subscription. The link to their computer science library is [https://www.perlego.com/browse/it-computer-science](https://www.perlego.com/browse/it-computer-science). Unsuprisingly, many of the staple CS textbooks (as defined in [AB1908/CS-Books](https://github.com/AB1908/CS-Books)) seem to be unavailable. I suspect this will change rapidly, though, as adoption increases. I am optimistic this will be the future for learning to program in combination with free OER and OCW. Online learning just keeps getting better and cheaper (and legal)!

I have long awaited a Spotify for Books. I think Perlego is probably the best chance by a company at succeeding at the attempt. Rather than focusing on books, they focused on textbooks, which is the primary need for a Spotify for Books. As soon as we get a "University Library on a tablet", people won't have to use Library Genesis. But as soon as someone finally completes the task of putting every textbook in an app, there will be very little need to pay for university to access their libraries too. Instead you can just read the equivalent assignments from an online syllabus at home for $15 a month. Why pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for the equivalent opportunity at just $12 a month? The benefit of a Spotify for Books for enabling affordable but quality education is immense.

Should I start making curricula for Perlego? Should I abandon making syllabi using OER, now that academic textbooks are available for just $12 a month? I suspect that in time, my entire website dedicated to free OER curricula will be deprecated. What's the need to read legal and free OER when you can read the most popular textbook legally for chump change? My hope is that Holm School becomes redundant, and people will turn to normal University syllabi for their reading assignments rather than using my web site to find OER-based syllabi. I myself am looking forward to that future, and I will certainly indulge. Perlego is a small operation (they have 1000 twitter followers at the moment). If you want to help contribute to the success of a company possibly enabling affordable education for the future generations, consider signing up for Perlego. The more people use this as their primary source for education, the more robust the textbooks available on their platform will be. A subscription model for books is just as important to have as Spotify/Apple Music is for music. No subscription model is going to kill the industry, that's just preposterous. It changes it, but it does not destroy it.

This is exciting for me because I've been putting off creating Perlego-based curricula since it wasn't available yet in the United States and I didn't want to spend the effort if it flopped. Seeing it released in the United States is very encouraging for the future of this company and its mission to provide cheap digital textbooks through tablets. You can educate yourself for free through OER, as this site attests, but $12 a month is very reason. 2 hours of minimum wage work is well worth the admission fee for tens of thousands of computer science textbooks. I would sacrifice netflix, spotify, and everything else for years to have the money to pay for Perlego until I reach the point where I get a junior dev job as a programmer if I weren't already employed. And then at that point I would use tuition reimbursement to fuel my CS degrees for free.

The future is rich for affordable, collegially independent self-education! Here's my hope that Perlego makes Holm School irrelevant, so the day and age when people couldn't afford textbooks becomes just a curious footnote in history! I might even add Perlego to my [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) subscription suggestions.

I know I will be signing up with Perlego! This is truly exciting EdTech! I wish them the best of luck in their mission to create a subscription-based academic book platform. With the success of Perlego, I can focus on other things than making OER-based Holm School curricula. I hear the death knell for Holm School! Thank you Perlego!

## #38 - Some Principles of Learning Computer Science Affordably

Principle One: Don’t Go To A College With Any Liberal Arts Departments/Degrees. This is ground zero for scam #1: Get unaware science students to supplement a disastrous liberal arts departments. Liberal arts departments suck all the money from their students, leaving them with a worthless degree for tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars Basically just like computer science, learning the humanities should cost you zero dollars through a public library/online library. The idea that you have to pay good money at a young age just to read books is patently exploitation. You won’t get a job in your liberal arts major, especially anything that you could do without a costly college degree, and the education you receive could be self-taught for free. Paying liberal arts professors just perpetuates the exploitation by student loans, and until these departments are ejected from colleges, you shouldn’t pay to attend a college. There are many nonprofit schools that don’t have liberal arts departments/degrees, such as University of the People and GATech OMSCS. Great Books courses/curricula can be downloaded for free off Project Gutenberg/Library Genesis and read on your own time, rather than on your own dime. I think the humanities are great and should be a principle of everyone’s education. I’m just confused about why that is presumed to be worth tens of thousands of dollars when I can do it for free through my public library/online library.

Principle Two: Stick with Nonprofits, Accepting Affordable For-Profits that Only Cost a Couple Hundred a Year. That is to say, if you get a degree, make sure it is from a nonprofit that costs as minimal of amount as possible to you. Aim to get a full ride to a university if you decide to go to a university at all. Don’t fall for gimmicky companies like Udacity that are for-profit and cost a lot more than other for-profit companies like PluralSight/Treehouse/Lynda that can leave you with debt for a just short duration of class time. For profit companies are kind of scammy, and paying anything more than a couple hundred of dollars a year to attend is like setting your money on fire. Basically only nonprofit degrees are worthwhile, truth be told. If you think you need to attend an expensive for-profit company to learn “the cutting edge,” you might be falling for advertising more than relevant educational experiences. There’s a lot of false hope. My budget for for-profit companies the past two years is $200 a year, and so far haven’t had any buyer’s regret. Currently, with my company paying for my PluralSight account and my public library paying for my Treehouse and Lynda account, my budget for for-profit education is zero, and I don’t feel like I am missing out of anything.

Principle Three: Don’t Worry About Resume Fodder/Degrees/Prestige. You are trying to become a computer scientist, not a walking medallion board. A task in computer science is accomplished by being knowledgeable about computer science, not by having a degree. Many people fret that if they don’t have a prestigious degree, they won’t be able to do computer science. My guess is that if you know computer science, you will get paid to do computer science work. Learning CS, fortunately, can be a very affordable process, costly at most a couple hundred a year. A degree never solved a computer science problem, a program developed by an educated computer scientist did.

Principle Four: Open Source is Quality in the Fact that Anyone Can Remedy a Problem. Open Source is sort of like peer review: If something is broken, anyone can fix it. The idea that using open source technology to fuel a computer science education might have once been seen as pie-in-the-sky, but with the progress of open source in computer science, there is no reason to assume it’s principles won’t also consume 100% of future educational processes. If you aren’t using open source computer science educations, you are probably getting ripped off. Just like you shouldn’t pay for an anti-Enlightenment liberal arts department, you shouldn’t pay for proprietary education when open source solutions exist and are free. If someone wants you to learn from proprietary resources, they will pay on your behalf: i.e. a job/internship paying for a PluralSight account or a public library (government) paying for a Treehouse/Lynda/SafariBooks account. You’re responsible for finding open source education resources, which means you need some education about open source education if you’re not capable of doing that on your own, but let other interests pay for non-open source educations. That seed money should be their burden, not yours. Open Source is free and philanthropic, and should be the foundation of contemporary computer science educations. If there is something wrong with an open source curriculum, someone else (or even YOU) can pull request the correction or else fork it yourself. In the world of modern society, if something isn’t open source you should be extremely skeptical of it. It might have some problems with it (including cost) that can’t be remedied by other people.

Principle Five: Github Will Someday Become an EdTech Provider. I can see computer classes being uploaded to Github in the future rather than YouTube. I can see CS education curriculum by default being hosted on github rather than other websites. I can see Github developing educational tools that will facilitate classes including discussion and supplemental reading. I can see people adapting github to provide fantastic educations in computer science with zero overhead costs and zero proprietary licenses that block adoption in low-wealth communities from participating. I can see free hosting for open source EdTech websites and groups. I can see people attending college on Github rather than enrolling at private universities, since Github will provide college-equivalent courses for free. I can see Github becoming an EdTech facilitator that makes non-free education obsolete. I think that end stage is in it’s beginning phases now, but that it won’t take long if Microsoft takes an interest in Github’s advantages for EdTech. I can see nonprofit open source EdTech as dominating future learning in facilitated by Github. I can see Github getting better and better for free educational communities and their students. I can see class conferences being attended on Github, and live courses being recorded and archived there too. I can see University of the People’s model of having volunteer professors being mirrored by Github repos and using volunteer professors to facilitate live classes using archived open source material. I can see great computer science books being made open source and hosted for free on Github. I can see everything needed for a college level computer science education being readily available for free on Github. I can see universities moving onto Github, and new Github-exclusive universities being invented. I can see Github becoming or at least creating an LMS. I think the combination of open source educational resources coupled with Github being an explosive power that can truly shake up the world. To ignore this potential is to risk money that could be put into index funds at a young age instead. If you are convinced Github is awesome for modern education now, as I am, it'll only get better in the future!

Principle Six: Success With Open Source EdTech Doesn’t Require Every Competitor to Collapse. I don’t want non-open source education facilities to burn. I think they should exist and be held responsible in the free markets. It is not a zero sum game, that in order for OER to succeed, colleges must burn. Things are obviously going to change, and I hope public universities, especially CS departments, realize that instead of competing with OER they should adopt and contribute to it. Though some greed will play a factor, I think the potential of some faculties to embrace OER rather than debase it holds explosive potential. If public universities could find a way to reduce their cost to be competitive with a couple of hundreds of dollars a year, then I wish them success, not failure. If public universities embrace open source, then I hope they succeed in the new millennium rather than going away. I don’t even think open source will be mandatory in the future, though I think smart people will realize if they aren’t using open source products they are risking their money. I think people should be free to use their money in ways they wish. But I hope they are educated about the changing landscape thanks to the invention of the internet, and the radical potential OER offers versus the-way-it’s-always-been-done. That’s why I promote meta-education, and create this blog to talk about it. Not because I want to top-down eradicate all non-open source companies, but because I believe the market should decide and the more literate people are about open source the less they’ll believe in tradition/superstition versus science/free-speech.

Principle Seven: This is About Happiness. https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/06/08/happiness-is-the-only-logical-pursuit/ This also applies to college, and should steer your decision tree. For some, sacrificing the happiness of prestige for the [happiness of millions](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-05-44-Reasons-Not-To-Go-To-College-To-Study-Computer-Science.html#31---retire-a-millionaire-by-skipping-college/) of dollars in retirement and early financial independence is a proper, well-examined, and rational decision. For some, they may settle on pursuing prestige. Everyone’s different. I am a proponent of FIRE and frugality, however, and think that should play a part in decisions even surrounding such traditional institutions as bricks and mortar colleges.

## #37 - Get a Full-Ride Scholarship to the College in Your Hometown, and Don't Move to a Different City

The best choice you can make in your life is to work hard in high school so that you earn a full ride scholarship to the public university in your hometown. Going to university for free or nearly free is very possible if there is a public university in your hometown. You'll be able to live at home, instead of spending hundreds of dollars of money on "rent" for a dorm room. Perhaps your scholarship will even cover the cost of a dorm room! If your hometown has a public university, don't squander the opportunity. You are blessed with a gift from the gods: there's a college in your hometown! Not having to pay rent in a foreign city will save you $600 a month! You can study computer science at a familiar university and a familiar public library! Would you go to high school out of state or in a different city when there is a high school in the same city? Of course not! The same logic applies to college: if there's a college in your hometown, of course you should go to it and live at home to save money. Your vehicle to a good life is in studying computer science for as cheaply as possible, not putting the horse before the cart and moving to another city before you even have your computer science training! You should wait to move to another city until you've secured a job in that city, not to attend college. Only move away from home if you have a source of income, and colleges are the complete opposite of that! Instead they are grossly overpriced and will burden you with debt at a young age, preventing you from investing in index funds in your 401k and IRA in order to gain compound interest for 40+ years. The thinking needs to change around college and the best option for judging which college you should go to needs to be the affordability ranked. You should go to whereever is most affordable, after including food and rent to tuition too. Usually this will be your hometown college. That's because nothing quite tops out living at home for four years while your main focus is on studying. Don't think that you can not live at home while you don't even have a job! You should live at home while attending college just like you live at home while attending high school. People don't get apartments while they're in high school. And people shouldn't get apartments while attending college if it's in your hometown.

Out of state college is the Rolls Royce of colleges. It is so expensive, it is criminal. There is a low return on investment, when you include travel, rent, and tuition expenses. A lot of students are told out of state colleges are "better" than their hometown college, and that hometown colleges are just "safety" schools. Unfortunately, with Open Education, you can learn from the best CS professors no matter where you attend (for free on the internet). With Library Genesis, the quality of your hometown college's library doesn't matter. You can learn computer science just as well at your hometown university than any private or out of state college. What's more important is to graduate with zero debt, so that you can sock away money in your IRA and 401k at age 22 for ten years so that it can compound for forty years, instead of paying off debt during that important time in your life. The later you wait to start investing, the less your returns. Roughly every 10 years your index fund investments double, so if you wait a decade to max out your 401k and IRA, you're cutting your yield in half by the time you retire. You shouldn't buy Rolls Royces you can't afford, and you shouldn't go out of state when you have the opportunity to attend college inexpensively in your hometown.

Neither should you move to another city in your state to attend a state university if there's one in your hometown. You're still stuck paying high rent prices (especially in those college towns that only exist because there's a university in them). State schools are a good option if there isn't a university in your hometown, but if there is it would be a wasted opportunity not to stay at home. Even in state college can become outrageously expensive when rent is incorporated to the total cost. Though staying in-state is better than going out of state, when it comes to learning computer science, since most of what you need to know can be learned at a public library, the university you attend matters less as long as your hometown college has a CS department.

Don't think you won't have any fun. Usually you'll be at the university library until 11pm anyway, so where you go to sleep for 7 hours doesn't exactly carry much weight for the amount of fun you have in college. You can still socialize on campus and off campus with your friends. In fact, you'll probably have more fun since you'll still be in contact with all your hometown friends, rather than uprooting yourself to an entirely different state. It's also a whole new experience to live in your hometown after you've turned 18, you have more freedom and you can really get a feel for what social activities are available in your hometown. Campuses usually have plenty of socialization spots, like the SU, so you don't need to use your "apartment" as a social activity spot. Keep it on campus or in other people's dorm rooms and just sleep at home when socialization and studying is over for the day. As long as you don't rush home as soon as classes are over, and instead pack lunch and dinner (a ziplock of lentils, peanut butter sandwiches, a tupperware of beans and rice), you can stay on campus and socialize with your friends. Just avoid home as much as possible, and just use it as a place to cook and sleep.

That's my advice: If you have a university in your hometown, it would be a wasted opportunity not to attend it, especially when college is so expensive. If you don't have a university in your hometown, I would recommend living at home still and doing the [$5200 F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html). You can explore other cities once you start securing jobs, doing in when you don't have the funds is just a horrible idea! You'll be glad you're debt free at 22-32 when your maxed-out 401k and IRA contributions, invested in 100% total stock market index funds, makes you a millionaire multiple times over by the time you retire at 60. After a decade of contributions, you won't even need to contribute any more and can put the remaining savings in a post-tax fund, which can [fuel an early retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/11/29/how-to-retire-forever-on-a-fixed-chunk-of-money/). Well worth the four years extra you spent at home! The earlier you start making frugal choices, even if that means not going to a prestigious out of state private college when you're qualified enough to get in to them, the earlier you'll become financially independent. 

In my case, my career didn't start until I went to my hometown college. After 6 years of unemployment from earning a liberal arts degree at an out of state private college, I just went for the most affordable computer science degree and that was obviously at my hometown college. I got an apartment nearby and walked to class. After three semesters of study, my department had some people come in from local companies, and I scored an summer internship on a web team because of my Treehouse learning. I now work for that company, doing web stuff. There's a lot to say for staying in your hometown, especially because you can remain close to your family. Running off to an out of state college isn't always the ticket to a successful career as it is marketed.

## #36 - It’s Not About Moocs, It’s About the Public Library – A Book Review of Excellent Sheep

Today I reread William Deresiewicz’s Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite on a whim after reading it last year. I remember this book positively, enough to want to reread it again, but on second read I was struck by some distinct ideological differences between myself and the author.

First, I would not promote liberal arts degrees as being extremely valuable and necessary for self-education. I’m an obvious fan of the liberal arts, I have an art history degree myself and spent four years in college in at least one humanities course each semester, but I would not promote studying liberal arts in college. College is expensive, and a liberal arts degree simply isn’t going to get you a job anywhere. Obviously there are the usual passages in the book that talk about how businesses value liberal arts degrees, but a simple check is whether businesses pay for tuition reimbursement for liberal arts degrees. Typically not, usually tuition reimbursement has to be for classes related to the job. Of course, there may be exception, but they are not the rule. The easiest solution to the cost of college is simply to download four years’ worth of humanities/Great Book courses taught at liberal arts colleges and just read the books yourself from the public library. This is free, and the idea that reading classics should cost money is all hype. Deresiewicz is a salesman of the liberal arts degree, but don’t believe what he is selling. The product is good, but the cost of it is astronomic if you buy it at college instead of the public library. In my opinion, it is not essential to discuss literature in a classroom, as classroom discussions usually only give you the opportunity to talk for about 30 seconds in the period of an hour, and otherwise reading a book alone should be enough to permit you to think critically about what you just read. You don’t need classroom discussion that cost twenty thousand dollars a year in order to learn from reading the classics.

Another complaint about the book is the pages dedicated to discrediting MOOCs. I’m not surprised an English professor sees no value in MOOCs, as classroom discussions are the raison detre of liberal arts professors’ salaries, but writing off MOOCs just shows why you should ignore the liberal arts (if it’s not completely free to you). His comparison makes sense and is seductive; of course, if you’re paying for college, would you rather take a Socratic seminar or a MOOC for your money? But that comparison is unjust, because MOOCs are free while college costs fifteen thousand dollars a year. If you ask me whether I’d take a MOOC or OpenCourseWare class on a computer science topic, or else pay $1000 to take an actual class, I would probably choose the MOOC coupled with some free textbooks from Library Genesis. The MOOC/OCW serves one purpose: to convey scientific topics for free to people who cannot afford college. The simple fact is, when I was studying computer science I reached a point where I ran out of funds to go to college. I had to turn to internet resources to continue my studies. And that’s where a MOOC is a valuable asset, because, even though it was incomparable to an actual college class, it permitted me to continue studying CS even when I didn’t have money.

I see this as a misunderstanding of what the issue is surrounding MOOCs. And just as his book shows, it is incredibly easy to write off MOOCs as a failure when you compare them to academia. But that’s not the comparison we should be making. We should be comparing Socratic seminars to public libraries, not MOOCs. Public libraries are colleges without the tuition cost. They supply you with an unlimited number of books at the expense of underserving you with regards to Socratic seminars. The wager is this: You’re more likely to grow as an individual from reading books, so we’re going to completely furnish you with free books, whereas classroom discussions are only ephemerally valuable, so we’re going to avoid the infrastructure cost associated with hosting classrooms and instead just focus on providing books. That’s a damn good wager, in fact I’m willing to place my bets that this model of self-education is what lives through the next century instead of expensive colleges. The simple fact that public libraries are now essentially on-demand online in the form of Library Genesis just shows how the public library model of reading at the expense of discussion is now escalating on a global scale. Library Genesis serves the entire planet the oeuvre of scientific books under the model of a public library. There is no equivalent of that for Socratic seminars (in some form of YouTube live discussions, or such) because that’s a failed self-education model. It literally costs you tens of thousands of dollars, when simply reading the book (the crux of the matter, truth be told) is free. In that sense, MOOCs are an extension of public libraries into lectures, in that now college classroom lectures are recorded and put on YouTube to be watched for free. That’s an extension of the public library model of extending the crux of the matter – the classroom lecture on a science topic – at the expense of sacrificing the classroom discussion, which cannot be digitized and archived and put online for free. That should be fine with you, because you learn from reading the book, not from discussing it to the point where you convey to your professor that you did the reading to the extent that you deserve an A. And in my opinion, that’s all Socratic seminars are, in actuality, at liberal arts colleges. Just students conveying to the professor that they did the reading. The idea that Socratic seminars are the crux of self-education is false. It is the reading of the (free from the public library) book, not the 30 seconds you are afforded in a classroom discussion.

And that’s why I’m not surprised Excellent Sheep ended with a completely unhinged final chapter. After appreciating the rest of the book for arguing for a liberal arts education, I was taken aback at the revolutionary tones of the final chapter, which argue for income distribution and basically class warfare. If that’s your conclusion for the reasons of defending the liberal arts, then even I am skeptical of the liberal arts. We don’t need revolution to ensure poor kids can go to college. We need to make sure that we use new technology to extend books and lectures to them for free on the internet. We need to make sure tablets and high speed internet are as affordable as possible. That’s going to be ensured through science, computer science, electrical engineering, and volunteer work by archivists. We need public libraries to extent beyond their four walls and serve books for free via internet databases, much like Library Genesis is doing, to ensure that kids can read science books even when they can’t drive or take the bus to the public library. We need to make sure that even if you can’t afford to college, you can succeed as a computer scientist that can start a career as a programmer even without in-person college classes under their belt. The idea that “moar college” is the solution to the problems engendered in our society by elite colleges is a laughing stock, and makes the entire book a bit of a farce that seemingly talked sweet nothings in your ear for nine tenths of a book only to turn into a conspirator in the last chapter. The solution is moar public libraries, not moar liberal arts degrees. And it just so happens that computer scientists have built some of the most incredible public libraries on the internet concerning computer science. Sure, it’s on the internet, but there isn’t much of a difference between deadwood and an ipad screen when you get down to the gritty details of reading words.

MOOCs aren’t the solution to college ills, because MOOCs aren’t college replacements but public library supplements. MOOCs aren’t a waste of time because they cost zero dollars. They are integrating the public library ethos in the domain of college lectures. Library Genesis takes the success of MOOCs and implements a college library for free on the internet for anyone to read any book they want in the topic of science. That’s the sort of thing that lets poor people get college-level educations for very affordable prices. Free textbooks coupled with free college lectures (in the form of MOOCs and OCW) are quite an admirable competitor to college classes, with their high price tag. Avoiding debt as a principle might motivate you to rely on free internet resources instead of paying for tuition, and you just might find that you are able to succeed as a programmer just as much as if you had gone to actual classes. Because the real crux of the matter is the books and the lectures, not the Socratic seminar. That’s why the solution to college debt crisis isn’t more liberal arts degrees, but promoting the liberal arts self-education that is possible through your public library or Library Genesis. Reading the classics doesn’t require classrooms if it requires you to go into debt. Self-education should be extremely affordable, if not free. Nothing about self-education requires big bills or loans for debt. If you keep the principle that liberal arts should be free, because learning computer science online is free, then you’ll find yourself receiving a liberal arts education by reading books through your public library, without the sort of debt that can suck the life out of you when you graduate at 22 and can’t find a job.
Books used to cost money, but we’re reaching the critical point where entire libraries are digitized and book online for free. A single public library, instead of serving one city, now serves the entire world online. It’s a jump in scale that is complemented by MOOCs and OCW on YouTube, which provide the meat and potatoes of computer science lectures for free and on-demand. It’s an amazing time to be a computer scientist or someone interested in the liberal arts. To enroll in college if it costs you money would be a huge mistake. By becoming a computer scientists without debt can afford you a life of financial independence, in which you can read and write as much as possible when you’re early retired. To think that starting off your life with a $60,000 debt just because you like to read is exploitation at its finest. Don’t be exploited just because you like to read. In a few years it will be seen as insane that people paid money (a lot of money!) for books, when they are all available on-demand online for $15 a month. Reading will experience a renaissance, and when every textbook on computer science ever written is available for free on Library Genesis, it is hard to justify paying tuition. MOOCs might be a failure compared to college. But when you compare what’s offered at public libraries around the world, which are augmented by services such as OCW/MOOCs, you see a much more competitive picture. Public libraries are being augmented by archives such as MOOCs and OCW, and they’re making the practice of going into debt to read books that you could read for free through your public library appear increasingly arcane. YouTube is essentially a public library. Library Genesis is essentially a public library. Public libraries are going to replace colleges as people realize there’s no need to go into debt for what can be (to a high degree) duplicated for free at a public library.

And that’s why I reject the conclusion of Excellent Sheep. Professors don’t make literature come alive, the authors who wrote the original book make literature come alive by fiat of what they created. We need more free and ubiquitous books, not more liberal arts professors. While liberal arts students have been getting PhDs in order to serve as professors in cush jobs, computer scientists have been digitizing the world’s books and putting them online for free download. Who do you think is going to take deeper steps into solving poverty? I laugh when I think about someone willingly believing liberal arts professors are going to be the solution. Their modus operandi is simply to suck tens of thousands of dollars out of people, rich and poor, who like to read books. It is an elaborate operation that replaces books, which are available free at public libraries, with Socratic seminar which, arguably at best, are valuable seemingly only because they aren’t reproducible for free by public libraries and internet archives. So what? So what about Socratic seminars? I’m not a philistine that doesn’t understand the liberal arts just because I think reading books is more important than discussing it with 20 other people who probably didn’t even do the reading, for $15,000 a year. I’m willing to be bashed by liberal arts professors like Deresiewicz for not appreciating the beauty of the Socratic seminar. I firmly believe it is not worth the money, for the very reason that it can’t be offered for free online. If that’s the case, it’s probably a scam.


## #35 - Free Books Hurt No One

When I was a junior in high school, I volunteered at my public library in the "Booktique," a store where they sold overstocked donated books and retired library books for a quarter each. I was really into quiz bowl at the time, so I figured I could fuel an extracurricular education that would contribute to my quiz bowl chops by building a library at home. Fortunately I had an entire wall of my bedroom made out of bookcases, so I managed to fill my shelves with interesting books spending about $6 each weekend at the store when I was done volunteering (I got a discount as a volunteer too, natch). That library is ultimately what made me become a liberal arts major instead of a physics major. I realized that Penguin Classic books were in abundant supply and practically free, and really darn enjoyable. I built up enough of a library volunteering at the library my junior and senior year that when I went to Reed College my freshman year, I barely even had to buy any books on the Hum110 syllabus because I already owned them (for a quarter! beat that!). I obviously saved a lot of money freshman year (and the additional books I bought on Amazon for just a few dollars -- a novel experiment, as this was 2003).

At the same time I was exposed to Lloyd J. Reynolds through a paideia class and the Lloyd Reynolds book stocked in the school bookstore. Within it was a list of art history books recommended to art history majors. This was weirdly attractive to me, as I realized that for about $15 in the bookstore I had just purchased an undergraduate degree curriculum in art history. I didn't really even need to go to class, I could just read these books and get a good education that could fuel an art history degree. I sort of became obsessed with this bibliography. My freshman spring break I was visiting my sister at Georgetown and I read Count Goblet d'Alviella's 'The Migration of Symbols', happy to have found this book (I remember going one by one down the bibliography at the Goergetown library computers finding out which books they had in their stacks). Even when I flunked out of Reed because of my developing schizophrenia my sophomore year, I wasn't perturbed about the disturbance to my art history education because I just emailed the Reed Archive historian and asked for the full listing of the recommended art history books (the book from the Reed bookstore only contained a scan of the first page). Things were going good. I had an art history college curriculum completely independent of any school I was attending, and the impetus was on me to sit my butt down and read rather than pay for classes. I often considered taking time off from enrolling at university just to finish reading this bibliography on my own time and dime.

Of course, this was a little naive. I had a hard enough time finding those books in the Reed library, let alone at the small-town college I was attending in Topeka now that I was no longer at Reed. So I tried but ultimately decided against reading these books because I didn't want to purchase them at Amazon. In fact, I'm not even sure Amazon had these books for sale at the time, if I remember correctly. Still, getting these books was like pulling teeth, I was making my way through the list very slowly as an undergraduate attending multiple colleges. KU had more of those books. I remember as a music student at KU I made a webpage for my music technology class that... of course... was all about the bibliography for art historians (and also copyright/open source natch). I didn't even need to take art history classes because I just needed to read this bibliography. It was very liberating, if frustrating because the books were hard to find.

Ultimately when I became a senior at Reed I decided to do my senior thesis on the bibliography. I had to compromise when I was instructed to focus on the sociology of higher ed using Bourdieu... I would have preferred not to have an assigned theorist, let alone a Marxist one, but I wrote up a senior thesis on Lloyd Reynolds fine and dandy. Upon leaving Reed and still having books on the biliography left to find and read, I started relying on Archive.org to get these books (this was around 2008). I celebrated each time one of those books was added to Archive.org.

This is going to sound ridiculous, but I realized what I had found was that college could be completely separated from classes and degrees as long as you had access to books. Books that a brilliant person had compiled and curated for you. When I was reading books like Count Goblet d'Alviella, I never thought to consider that being an art historian was something that came about due to degrees and certifications, advanced or otherwise. I saw that the task as a "student" was to read books by history's best historians, and that this transfer of knowledge happened through reading the appropriate esoteria history that would never appear on a modern curriculum. I realized this when we were assigned a journal article about how we shouldn't ever use Panofsky again because of some stupid semiotic reason or other from a book that began each chapter with a quote from Derrida. It was bullshit, and I saw that it was bullshit, and I said so in class that I disagreed with it. My professor's response was to ask at the end of class, "Everyone now disagree with Panofsky's notion of 'disguised symbolism?'" After I shook my head no, she said to the whole class, "You'd better!" Okay. And this was from a professor of Northern Renaissance art, the very time and location of the birthplace of freemasonry. It's hard to look at the Arnolfini Portrait, and see a man wearing masonic clothing holding up a masonic sign with his hand and not wonder, hmmm, what exactly was going on back then? Durr. The feeling I have about 'disguised symbolism' and art history/Northern Renaissance is perfectly summed up by this YouTube video: ["Secrets in Plain Sight."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHhgLnIvuAs) 

This was the kind of shit that happened at my time at Reed that made me realize the "modern" curriculum I was getting in class was conspiratorily stupid compared to the freemason-y education that was in research circles around fifty years prior (at Reed). It's just the simple fact that Marxism can suck a left one compared to freemasonry, and no one can convince me otherwise. If you ask me if I want to join a Marxist club or the freemason, you can bet my answer would be the freemasons. In fact, because I worked at the public library's booktique, I came home with books like the Gulag Archipelago and A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which were some of my favorite books. I am an atheist, so I can't ever join the freemasons, but I feel as if it is superfluous anyway as I am an art historian 'trained' by this bibliography compiled by Lloyd Reynolds and years of reading Penguin and Oxford Classic books for a quarter each from the booktique. It's amazing how free thought comes at the butt end of a free freemasonry bibliography, instead of a Marxist's gun. Good books to train future masons will always conquer passive-aggressive pomo journal articles written to pad a CV to score a hipster a professorial job.

Now, the reason I wanted to write this article was to explain why Holm School is so focused on compiling syllabi instead of creating new content. Because I sincerely believe good content is already in the public domain because it was written centuries ago. These books are so affordable that they can be purchased for $0.25 two decades ago. The simple fact is, now with Library Genesis, these books are free.

You no longer need to concern yourself with access to books. Book access is no longer the driving force behind affordable self-education. There was a time when I struggled to find access to the books on the art history bibliography. Now I can download each one of Library Genesis. There was a time when I had to take a loan out in order to buy the books on my Hum110, Hum210, and Hum220 syllabi. Now they are all online for free.

This is the inevitable outcome of human culture. Culture is free, you do not need to take out loans to access it. Knowledge will generate ways to ensure that it is free in a capitalist, liberal democracy. That's why liberal democracy was invented, to perpetuate knowledge. The fact that I couldn't complete my quest to read the totality of the bibliography fifteen years ago isn't disappointing to me. I simply couldn't access those books until 2020. Sometimes you just have to be patient for the [knowledge of the world to be finally be available to you](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-07-Art-Curriculum.html/). What created Archive.org? It was the ideal of democracy engendered by "free/open source culture" that views Fair Use as just as important as intellectual property. Does anti-humanism stand any chance compared to humanism? No, it does not, no matter how many times it is assigned by hipster professors on college syllabi. This horrible cult that has taken over the university and turned a place of integrity and respect of humanity and culture into the autistic beating of the dead horse that is the anarchist critique of power/hegemony. A fool can see humans don't relate to each other through power, simply by reading the history of literature over thousands of years. Yet this is the paradigm that infuses 100% of humanities departments, and calls brilliant masons and freethinkers "dead white men" as if some humans were more valuable than others based on genetics instead of the content of their thought and character. The irony of freemasonry being called "dead white men" is obvious to anyone who explores their thought.

This is an ode to the booktique and Selected Bibliographies written by extremely erudite people. Those bibliographies, as in my Bookstore book, can simply be photocopied, emailed, or put up on the internet for anyone to read. Those books, just like the booktique fiften years ago, can now be acquired for chump change through Library Genesis or Perlego. It doesn't really matter anyway, because the people worth reading are now long out of copyright. If you think ubiquitous free books hurt authors, you aren't realizing that the authors worth reading in an education curriculum are dead anyway. New books from new "critical theorists" are bullshit and not worth reading, let alone pirating. The real meat and potatoes of education (in all fields other than STEM) happened more than 70 years ago. Those books are free and readily available online now. That's because those books were always free and always readily available, they were just at the Booktique instead of LibGen. But it's the same idea, and that idea has been in perpetuity since the beginning of time. There will always be free or affordable books, because the best ideas worth learning are going to find a way to be free, whether that means changing the laws to accomodate this feat or not. Anyone who tries to ban books on justification authors living in the cornucopia of wealth that is 2020 can't make ends meet are wrong. It is progress that we have the internet, which is a free digital public library. People have tried to have their books removed from public library bookstores since time immemorial, but those people are idiots. They exist, but they are irrelevant. Do you really think the ideas of someone who wants their books removed from public libraries is worth reading? They are not. People who create real culture don't do so out of hope that it makes them wealthy. People who create real culture do so because they grew up immersed in real culture. It is self-perpetuating, and exists outside the realm of copyrightists and publishers/labels. To value cultural content like character and thought by the list price of the creation is as silly as judging people by genetics. It's irrelevant to the larger question that is humanity and brotherhood and what we want as a civilization.

My point is that you don't need to enroll in classes to get a good education. In fact, you'll probably get a bad one, one influenced by the hipsters who went to college in the eighties and think French theorists are worth dedicating a life to. Personally, I think masonry is worth dedicating a life to instead. You are more likely to find masonry in the college curriculum from the fifties rather than today's curriculum. The benefit is that those books from the fifties curriculum are out of copyright and free. The hipsters try to convince you that those authors are "racists" and "misogynists," when in fact anti-racism and feminism came out of their thoughts.

The good news is, you don't need a university. You need a list of good books. Those good books are free on the internet, and will always be because that is the purpose of the internet: free books. You can fuel an entire lifetime of investigation and free thought with just a few years of studying the books that are in the public domain on the internet. The idea that you need to pay money to access knowledge should come off as extremely silly to anyone in the know about democracy. Knowledge will always be free, it is the crap knowledge that's not worth your time that costs money. Because democracy is good engineering, and good engineering is open source, knowledge will always be open source. The people who are convincing you that you need to buy the latest and greatest critical theorists books and curricula for a lot of money have built up a corrupt system that relies on this shilling for their own livelihoods at the exclusion of your own, because bad engineering is never self-perpetuating nor democratic. For some reason, bad engineers are running the academic machinery at the moment. I hope it will end. Every sword has two sides: the internet facilitates the reading of wonderful historical books for free. If you are treating the internet as anything other than a library, you are probably being exploited. The internet is not a place to make friends or socialize. The internet is a place to acquire books and that's it. The people who treat the internet as as important as real life ('hyperreality!') are the sort of unsightly nerds that rule the universities at the moment. Instead of assigning books written 4400 years ago, [they're assigning Lady Gaga](https://harpers.org/archive/2010/10/american-electra/). Why people would pay money for this I'm not sure, but business is booming for these anti-humanist 'academics.'

It doesn't cost money to read classic books. They are $0.25 at the booktique. My guess is you're not going to find a way to listen to Lady Gaga's latest album without paying. That's the difference between the competing ideologies in academia, humanists and anti-humanists. One will be public domain and open source and free, the other will be behind an expensive University paywall.

Believe that that world of free education is possible, and declare yourself independent from the university system. It doesn't matter where you study, as long as you are studying good books. Anyone can contribute to society through what they self-teach through non-copyrighted books. To think you have to fork over money to educate yourself has always been something that reveals a lack of critical thinking, rather than a hallmark of it as defined by a prestigious university degree.

I like the idea that Perlego has curated book recommendations. I think this is sometimes all that is needed to self educate as long as you have unrestricted access to the books on that list. You don't need to get a certificate or degree, you don't need to pay thousands of dollars to be taught in a lecture the content of books, you need to sit your butt down and read those curated books, sometimes multiple times. Find a person you sincerely trust (nearly with your life) and use their recommendations to fuel your education no matter how long it takes you to read all their recommendations. You'll find that that person can create a curated bibliography which costs nothing in expense to them, but that can be distributed to thousands of people as a means of a free education. There are no time limits, you are not forced to read it in four years, you can spend two decades reading from their bibliography if needed. Seek knowledge and truth and you'll find there are no tuition fees or loans required. Share that knowledge that you are privileged to have from a trustworthy source and share it around whatever means you have. People will find a way, like you, to access that knowledge if they also sincerely want it. You cannot paywall knowledge. Knowledge cannot be contained through restrictions or technology or law. Truth is the truth and will always be the first priority in human interaction. To paywall knowledge is to destroy what it means to be a sentient animal on Earth. No DMCA will help you there, [no matter how many times you threaten to sue MP3 downloaders](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/03/19/make-it-big/). It's just impossible in the world dominated by homo sapiens' science. Truth will conquer anti-humanism.


## #34 - Important Knowledge is in Books, and There Are Many Free Digital Books

I am promoting book learning over video learning here at Holm School. In the day and age where MOOCs are ubiquitous and free concerning many topics of computer science, and public libraries subscribe to video tutorial sites like Lynda or Treehouse, what is the purpose of learning through books? There are no subscription-based software like Spotify for books, where you can borrow any book every written electronically for a set monthly fee. Books are expensive! And it seems to be antiquated technology compared to video tutorials. But books hold important knowledge, and participating in focused study of texts for four years during your college years can afford you essential knowledge that engenders a lifetime of skills to carry you through your years of work. You'll learn how to learn if you read computer science texts. In learning CS through texts, you'll participate in the long legacy of computer science as an academic discipline that has created the world we benefit from today thanks to technology. To foreswear books is a huge mistake, whether you're studying science or the liberal arts, because it teaches you how to have discipline and focus. You require quiet, non-distraction, and a desk where you can study. These are the environmental variables that promote creativity and introspective thought. You aren't just learning a topic when you read a book, the fact that you are being studious in a quiet space promotes synthesis of what you're taking in so that you can turn it into introspective thought.

The fact is, in the future books are going to be extremely cheap. We are in the process right now of digitizing the archive, and once that is complete books will be easily duplicated, electronically stored, and delivered to people's tablet computers. Books, which usually cost $10-35, will soon be available for $10 a month, like Spotify. There are many people that realize this and are trying to build video libraries as a way of preserving their high monthly subscription fees. Most computer science video tutorial sites cost $25-35 a month. Compared to $10 a month, it seems silly to pay the premium price when the end goal-- learning a computer programming language or framework-- is the same for both mediums. The fact is that video tutorials require a lot less thought to take in, you can just kind of auto-play them, so they seem like less work. But books are also powerhouses of information. Oftentimes they go much deeper into the frameworks and give specific detail that give you a greater understanding of the technology. To skip this depth, just to shave a few hours off the time you're obligated to study is a huge mistake. In the future, books will be written less frequently in exchange for more-frequent production of video tutorials. To think this is because the medium is better for tutelage would be gravely mistaken. Books require less server space to host, so creating video prevents piracy because it requires more bandwidth to share. Hence, instead of being freely shared through the internet, video tutorials are usually safely ensconced behind a paywall without much of a threat of being ripped. Books, on the other hand, are just one megabyte. They are very easy to transmit and store. Hence, they will be more difficult to monetize because if you are overcharging for the product, people will just resort to piracy. In the future ebooks will be extremely cheap while videos will be as costly as the companies can get away with charging.

Don't give up on books. Video tutorial companies want you to disqualify the entire spectrum of books as outdated and useless. Don't believe the hype, they are protecting their bottom line. Ebooks are so frugal that you can even read OER for free! The lack of production costs for ebooks permits authors to release computer science textbooks with open source licenses for no charge. This practice will only increase in frequency as ebooks become less and less expensive, and the potential for earning capital from books decreases as well. Because the capacity to learn from books is just as equal to video, you really stand to gain if you keep with OER, ebooks, and public library books. To be a good, capable reader is ensuring that you will be frugal both in study and scholasticism (reading textbooks and tutorial books), but also entertainment (reading books instead of subscribing to video streaming services). Reading is the super power of all frugal people. They are poised to be the best way to save money in the future, especially when someone creates a monthly subscription service that is only $10/month for all the books ever written. In my opinion we are at a precipice in which this service will come out within a decade. If you rely on OER and public library books for the time being, you will save money and earn yourself skills for employment all while keeping costs as low as feasibly possible. If your public library subscribes to video tutorial websites for free on your behalf, by all means take advantage of their selection. But if they don't, rely on OER and the public library's computer science stack as the principle means of learning computer science. Books promote healthy thought and creative invention, and you'll find that scholasticism is an important skill for anyone who works as an inventor in the knowledge economy. Scholasticism and your relationship to learning from books is almost the parallel of how you create quality products and technologies. You set up the same environmental parameters as when you read a book-- quietness, no distractions-- and instead of consuming a book produce a book. Because the circumstances are mirror images of each other, when you read a book you are practicing inventing at the same time. The skills are complementary, and the main reason reading books is such a valuable hobby and a deep personal investment.

Now is a great time to be a reader. Part of the main benefits of being a computer scientist is the joy you experience when you read a computer science text and understand it! Scholasticism is a wonderful society in which to participate. Though books have traditionally been very expensive, creating the demand for public libraries in the first place, ebooks are so cheap that it has created the demand for OER. This website's purpose is to aggregate the best computer science OER so that you can become a computer scientist at absolutely no cost except your internet expenses! If you are a capable reader, which comes about as a result of reading as often as you can, you can save a ton of money while training yourself in the art of scholasticism. The idea that scholasticism costs a lot of money because of college tuition is a myth! Public libraries are a great alternative to college libraries and permit you to spend hours a day reading and studying in a quiet location. Don't pass up the opportunity the public library and OER provides by permitting you to access computer science texts for free! You'll gain computer science skills while also improving your reading, which makes you a more critical thinker! Books are here to stay, as proof by the fact that there has yet to be a monthly subscription service invented. There is still room for innovation in their delivery and the benefits of this innovation will be cheaper books for everyone!

If you are frugal, you must also be a reader. Important knowledge is in books, and to think they'll just up and disappear ignores the very true technological feat that soon you'll be able to download at will every book ever written. It's probably a decade off. Learn computer science by reading and you'll be highly skilled in the subject matter while gaining the ability to learn anything else that is invented along the way. It's a win-win circumstance.

One of the most exciting projects for a computer scientist has to be [EbookFoundation's free-programming-books repo on GitHub](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books). This collection of texts sorted by programming language contains proof that no matter what language you want to learn, there are always TONS of free books with which you can study. Oftentimes I'll be deciding whether I want to subscribe to a video tutorial site like PluralSight for $200 a year, and then I'll take a look at that list and breathe a sigh of relief because I know I can study languages for free, without spending hundreds of dollars a year. If you already have your CS degree from a community college or public university, OER provides sufficient coverage to allow you to study new languages (since you effectively know how to study programming languages already) in your quest to be a lifelong learner. Don't believe you have to spend hundreds of dollars at a video tutorial site to acquire new skills. If you are willing to study with OER, you can be extremely frugal and still learn new skills and languages and frameworks. There is a glut of OER, at the point where there are more OER books than there are time for you to read them. Though video tutorial sites are nice, I'm not willing to spend much more than $200 a year total on them given how ubiquitous good tutorials are thanks to OER authors. Education is a good thing to budget for, sure, but when I look back at my pluralsight subscription I realize I've only gone through about 10 tutorials in total the past year. That's almost $20 for each 3 hour tutorial. Ultimately that's because I get Treehouse and Lynda for free through my public library, so I use their services quite a lot which bites into my PluralSight time. But I also realize that spending $200 a year is a bad idea when I can just read an OER book for free. I'm pretty sure I can learn more in a book which takes 20-30 hours to read than I can a three hour lecture, and so paying $20 for a video tutorial while an OER book is free is a waste. Stick with the books catalogged by [EbookFoundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books) and you can become a skilled programmer extremely frugally. Don't be swept up by the allure of video tutorial websites. They are good if they are provided free through your public library, but if you have to pay to subscribe you might be better off using a curriculum of OER. That doesn't even include the fact that your public library probably has programming books for free too! What a time to be a computer scientist! You can get your first job programming for the cost of your broadband subscription alone if you use OER combined with your public library. Keep studying how to study computer science and streamline your education budget to save the most amount of money possible. Don't think you need an expensive degree to do computer science.

## #33 - Lectures are Books

I am going to write about one of the most difficult roadblocks to a student getting over their feelings of obligation to pay for an expensive bachelors degree. This roadblock is the idea that lectures are non-reproducible, that they exist outside of the economy of ebooks and that because of this, the high costs of college study must be justified. But in the days of cell phones being full-fledged video production machines, this concern does not hold water. A college lecture can be recorded digitally and uploaded to YouTube for free. This can be viewed an infinite amount of times for no hosting cost, making the audience for the lecture unbound from the size of seats in the classroom.

One problem is students think lectures are actually discussions. This is not the case, believe me. Once you spend enough time at college, you realize that most often today professors rely on a powerpoint display and talk at the powerpoint for an hour and a half. This is not criticism, I think in general this can be an effective means of relaying information. But to think that this format is impervious to digitalization can't be justified. There is nothing about it that a cell phone can't be used to record. In fact, sometimes its easier just to skip the camera and screencast while speaking with perhaps a wacom included in there. The formats are essentially the same: a cellphone-recorded lecture and a screencast with audio convey the same information and neither compromise the function of the instruction. Classroom discussion rarely happens, and usually it's not much beyond the people wanting to convey the message that they read the required reading. Discussion is such a small side-effect that the notion of paying tuition just for it alone is a real sunk cost, in the day and age of open education. Discussion doesn't turn you into some free-thinking renegade that soars at conversation and dazzles everyone with your social wit and charm. Maybe in the humanities? (haha, no). Certainly not in computer science. Not to say that there isn't room for philosophy of CS, but you don't usually think of philosophical discussions as the cornerstone of a computer science class.

My question is just to unbundle the illusion of college. If you are a good instructor, why would you limit your instruction to 30 students maximum instead of recording yourself and putting it on YouTube so that millions of people could benefit from your lecture? Again, I emphasize that with screencasting and perhaps a wacom, you can convey all information contained in a normal college lecture with a whiteboard and digital projector. People are facing student debt crisis because the economics of traditional college classrooms is unsustainable: You pay premium prices to be the elite 30 students that hear a semester long lecture by a good professor that no one else is allowed to attend and hear. You are paying for exclusivity. But this exclusivity is annoying at best and toxic at worst. You are hiding education behind a paywall that working class students are increasingly unable to pay for. There are consequences to the uber-inflation in tuition price.

The cost of non-public college is so immense that I doubt it has much of a future, especially when you consider that open education will continue to be recorded and served on YouTube or Google for free. The economics of the college lecture rely on students believing that classroom discussion and interaction is so important that digital lectures are worthless and in fact detrimental. The fear is that if a student studies online they will be stunted, a social mute with such dwarfed social cognition that they will be unable to hold up a conversation with anyone, especially with an interviewer during their job search. They will lack social grace and be so awkward that they won't have any friends and they will be left in the dirt and forgotten, victims to the will of hoodlums and street rats. If you do not believe online learning has stigma, then you probably don't question why people pay a quarter of a million dollars for four years of knowledge they could learn for free through YouTube. But online learning has a huge stigma. That's the reason that there are thousands of quality computer science classes on the internet for free but people spend money they don't have to study at a bricks and mortar college.

I propose an observation: Everything you need to know to be a programmer in life you aren't going to learn in just four years. You are going to have to study programming for a lot longer if you hope to produce quality computer science. And yet college ends at four years. If you are going to have to rely on the internet to learn new programming skills once you're done with college, why not avoid paying for college and learn programming skills on the internet four years earlier? It's basically unavoidable anyway, you have to gain the ability to study by yourself online if you intend to keep abreast of your field. There's nothing particularly different that occurs at year five of study. The knowledge doesn't become less valuable or any other weird permutation that justifies online study when the first four years don't. It's just a continuation of being a lifelong learner and programmer. Computer Science developed the internet to perpetuate itself. Computer Science created OpenCourseWare to perpetuate computer science classes. Computer Science is ensuring that in the future any knowledge you hope to glean about computer science is readily available for free. The only limit is your knowledge of the topic and time/investment, not the amount of money you're willing to hand over. Part of learning computer science is knowing the intricacies of what is feasible with computation and computers. And at the current moment in history, with all the internet services like hosting and cheap pocket computers, learning a bachelor's degree equivalent of computer science is possible for free. If you fail to grasp this concept, you fail a bit as a computer scientist. If you do understand this concept-- you've seen the OER, the OpenCourseWare, the YouTubes and the Public Library Stacks-- then you realize that the only hindrance to actually doing it for yourself is energy, or more probably the social stigma of being self-educated.

The reluctance of current professors at universities to digitize their courses out of resentment towards technology. Professors are sometimes resentful of technology, and it's a great reason why, as a computer scientist who develops technology, you should be skeptical of expensive colleges: You are trying to encourage technology, yet the resentment of college professors towards digitization of classes points towards their hatred of technology. You aren't really going to glean what you want to glean as a computer scientist from people that are passive aggressive towards computer science and technology. Computer Science _is_ self-education. Computer Science _is_ online learning. Computer Science _is_ free and non-paywalled. Those are central tenants to modern computer science, in my opinion, and ultimately the infrastructure is in place for you to reap the rewards of many past decades of hard labor to set this infrastructure up for your generation.

But the hindrance is stigma. The hindrance is your fear of ostracism. The hindrance is your fear of being made fun of or devalued. The stigma of free and online learning keeps kids buying private, elite lectures that they can't afford. It makes them take out student loans for tens of thousands of dollars at the first threat of difference. Stigma is what keeps kids paying for an economically unsound and unsustainable model/relic from the past that, cult-like, outright denies modern technology and its cost-saving benefits. I'm not saying the college lecture isn't helpful, it's awesome stuff. All I'm saying is that every lecture any professor gives can easily be digitized and uploaded for free. And that classroom discussion and interaction isn't worth the tens of thousands of dollars you have to pay for building expenses, maintenance of lawns, sports teams, student gyms, and fraternities. Plus the profit motive that is manifesting itself as an aggressive plotting against the digital future that doesn't rely on paywalls, manufactured exclusivity, or tuition by promoting stigma and the self-educated. Expensive colleges aren't in the blueprint of the future. You can go through the five stages of loss-- denial anger bargaining depression acceptance-- regarding the end of the era. Think how obsessed students are with the SAT! Those obsessions are going to be seen as quaint when all knowledge-- books, lectures, music, film-- is available for free on the internet. I'm not proposing stigma against college students, I just want to emphasize how social dynamics are changing from college-centric learning to internet-centric learning. Personally I don't prefer one over the other, except that internet-centric learning just happens to be $45 a month for a broadband subscription while colleges sometimes cost a quarter of a million dollars. Until college becomes free, I will promote self-education through public libraries and Open Educational Resources, which are free. Student debt is dangerous.

Just like books are becoming cheap and openly licensed as they become digitized, so too lectures will be. That is because lectures are books, even though they don't at first look like it. They just require video and audio instead of text. But they will become free and ubiquitous as computers and hosting becomes free and ubiquitous too. There is nothing special about a lecture that can't be conveyed through a book. There is nothing special about a college lecture that prevents it from being hosted for free on the internet. The only difference is effort, and most college professors balk at the idea of digitizing their semester class. . They rely on exclusivity to earn the tuition that keeps them funded. Professors hold a privileged spot in society and they fear the implications of anyone learning from them for free, which they see as skimming. They paid a lot for their PhD and are looking to benefit economically from their investment. But professors probably won't become unfunded if they digitize their classes. They probably won't be useless in the future economy that prioritizes computer scientists. No one is harmed by helping poor people. There is no opportunity cost to helping students who can't afford community college. Yet they act like they will be if they digitize anything related to college, and that's why they still use $150 textbooks and charge $15,000 a year for tuition instead of spending their time uploading their knowledge to YouTube. Fortunately, some professors are doing this and they will be the standardized texts for future generations of programmers.


## #32 - A Master's Degree in Computer Science Paid For Through Summer Jobs


"When I was in college at the University of Illinois from 1968-72, the total annual cost was $1,200. This $1,200 covered everything:  Tuition, books, rent, food and even a little entertainment.

Each 12-week summer I worked taking down diseased Elm trees. I was paid $20 a day over a six-day week. I saved $100 a week and by Fall had the $1,200 needed for the school year.

Of course, I lived in one room of a dilapidated old house that should have been condemned. White rice and ketchup served as dinner two or three times a week."

- JL Collins, ["Debt: The Unacceptable Burden"](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2015/03/26/stocks-part-xxviii-debt-the-unacceptable-burden/)

Here's my four-year online curriculum for potential computer science students who want to earn a bachelor's and even a master's degree.

The separate cost is $1200 for Treehouse, $4000 for UofPeople, and $800 for PluralSight (each for four years). Internet will be $2160. The total cost is $8160, or $170 a month.

First off you should use UofPeople for the bachelor's degree. Combine that with this site's listing of OER books for each subject you study, and you will be able to get a good CS education. You will have to work above and beyond the minimum course requirement, and study books that aren't assigned. This will speed up your progress, however, and classes will become easier. The more effort you pump into early progress by working 100% of your free hours on computer science, the sooner you can delve into more interesting CS subjects like AI (where the jobs are too).

At the same time that you're studying UofPeople and also the OER curriculum listed here on this site, you should also study at Treehouse. Treehouse is expensive at $25 a month, and the courses don't usually cover computer science topics but instead web development. If you are interested in web development (or the languages offered at Treehouse), you should subscribe at the same time you're working on your UofPeople degree. You'll learn practical skills that can be used in a job. Try to get 100% completion of Treehouse's curriculum in the four years you're paying for it.

PluralSight will help you learn more corporation-friendly programming. Here you can learn Microsoft's stack, etc., that can help you learn job-friendly skills. There are also good business classes and professional development tracks ("Upgrading Your Technology Career"). You can really supplement your CS learning by PluralSight courses. For example, the CCNA and CompTIA Network+ courses are great for learning networking principles.

The total cost of $6000 can be paid off working two summers at minimum wage. You could also work a 5 hours a week to absorb the cost of the subscriptions and UofPeople throughout the four years.

At the end of the four years, when you have a bachelor's degree from UofPeople and know 10+ programming languages and frameworks, you'll be able to get a junior programming job.

When your job has tuition reimbursement, sign up for Georgia Tech's OMSCS graduate degree in the field of your interest (AI, ML, Robotics, or Systems). This will cost $7000 but will be at least halved or possibly quartered by your job's tuition reimbursement benefit. This program is for working adults. You'll have to work your butt off, but you can come out in two or three years with a graduate degree in CS. With my work's benefits, this graduate degree would cost $2400 total!

All this can be supplemented through OER, the public library's CS stack, your local university library's CS stacks, and online video subscription services provided by your public library like Lynda.com (some public libraries even provide Treehouse subscriptions). The more CS books you read in your four years of study, the more you'll be prepared for a job. Read read read!

So, all in all, you can get a master's degree in CS for something around $13,000 (including internet fees). Not too shabby! Given that this is six years in duration, you could pay for it through summer jobs. And after six years of study, you'll be pretty darn good at programming!

Work your butt off and study CS online!

Final note: You can probably learn just as much using OER and your public library using the curriculum provided here on this website, and do all of this studying for free! Personally I would just rather work a bit and pay up the $12,000 dollars to earn a master's degree, but if that option is off the table for you, know that you don't have to subscribe to these online educational websites and can instead learn for free through OER and your public library. As soon as you get a first job you can start your tuition reimbursement benefits and make it up. Nothing is wrong with relying on OER and your public library, it's a very sensible and frugal choice.

In summary (six years in duration):

For four years:

University of the People B.S. in CS

Treehouse

PluralSight

Internet/Raspberry Pi

For two years:

Georgia Tech's OMSCS M.S. in CS (tuition reimbursement through a job)

Internet/Raspberry Pi

As low as $13,000 total

## #31 - Retire a Millionaire by Skipping College

I was playing around with a compound calculator today, wondering about how someone could benefit by not having to pay tuition costs when they turned 22. If, instead of entering the work force with the challenge of paying off $60,000 in debt, they instead entered the workforce debt free and invested that $60,000 in VTSAX or VFIAX upfront at the age of 18.

I've made this argument before on former websites, that instead of paying tuition, you should just buy a cheap house to live in for the rest of your life. But to put the opportunity cost of graduating with debt in perspective, things really become stark if you compound your opportunity cost on tuition.

Let's say you decide to go with the Holm Schooling course lined out of these pages. Instead of going to college, you are going to use your public library, a cheap PluralSight account, and Library Genesis to study computer science for four years from age 18-22 instead of enrolling in college. If you took the $60,000 you would have spent on tuition, which you are obligated to pay back starting around age 22, you would have 47 years for which you could be compounding. Retire at 65, invest $60,000 at age 18 instead of paying tuition = 47 years of compounding. By paying tuition instead of investing that $60,000, you are turning down roughly $1,442,742 at retirement, compounded at 7% gain.

I think 1.4 million dollars speaks for itself. By going into debt while young, you are sacrificing the potential compounded gains of investing early. If I were young, I would be doing everything possible in my power to avoid any and all debt, while trying to get a programming job as soon as possible so I could start maxing out my 401k and IRA. By living frugally when young and investing 50-80% of your take home pay into VTSAX or VFIAX index funds, you are allowing yourself to set into motion compounding gains that you can sit back and watch develop into a retirement savings with only 10 years of work, when you are 22-32.

Let's run the calculator another way. In this circumstance, you don't get the value of tuition up front as a benefit of avoiding tuition. Instead, you have to begin your IRA when you are 22, fresh out of studying computer science for four years using OER and your public library. With no debt, you can sock that first years salary into saving. Say you make $55,000. If you save 80% of your pay by maxing out your 401k ($19,000 pretax), IRA ($6000 pretax), and then putting the rest into a post-tax Vanguard brokerage account ($15,000 posttax), you could see around $40,000 being saved every year.

Put $40,000 principle into a compound calculator at 7% for 9 years and you wind up being 32 years old with $586,196 in savings. Not enough to retire on, but then again you have to consider that your salary will probably go up with ten years experience. Sit on that $586k from ages 32-65 and let it compound and you wind up retired at 65 with $5,466,479. Of course, if you keep living frugally and working from ages 33-65, you wind up retired at 65 with $10.56 million dollars. Of course, that's not including housing, but if you buy affordable housing the hit shouldn't be too large.

Chew on that. If you save $40,000 every year by living frugally from ages 22-65, you can retire with $11 million dollars. $40,000 is a lot to save every year, but if you do things like live at home throughout your twenties and eat Whole Foods plant-based vegan food like beans, lentils, oatmeal, and potatoes, you can seriously at least see how living frugally as a computer scientist (with all the free online education opportunities you have) permits you to either retire extremely well, or else retire early.

And that's what I want to convey about college tuition. It's simply way too expensive given the values you should hold at age 18-22. You should be trying to get a first job while spending as little money as possible on education, so that you can begin saving while you're young to get compounding gains for 40 years instead of just 20-30. You should view debt as anathema, because your goals should be to live as frugally as possible from age 22-32 so that you can dump all your earnings into your 401k, IRA, and post-tax Vanguard account. If you earn a median programming wage of $50-60k a year from ages 22 to 42, you could retire at 42 with a 80% savings rate. If your salary swells to around $100k by the time you're mid twenties, you could retire by 35 if you maintain that savings rate.

If you don't believe me, just play around with a compound calculator with an 80% savings rate and a salary of $50k from projective ages of 22 to 65. You'll see staggering numbers that quickly provide enough of a nest egg to retire off of by the time your 65. Computer programming is not only a good job, but you can study it for free with OER, your public library, and Library Genesis. By avoiding student debt at the critical ages of 22-32 when you should be building up your savings account to prepare for decades of compounding, you are building for yourself a future.

The ironic thing would be to put yourself in the shoes of a parent. Instead of paying $60,000 when your kid turns 22, invest that money on your kid's behalf when they are born. If you saved up for your kid's college before they were even born, 65 years of compounding on an initial investment of $60,000 would be $4.88 million dollars. That's if you put the opportunity cost of college tuition into a savings account owned by your baby when they were born. Since that's entirely feasible of a circumstance, college could wind up costing you $4.88 million dollars. That's the power of compounding interest. You want it to work in your favor by saving compounded gains, not against you by being in debt paying interest charges.

I think as FIRE (financial independence/early retirement) takes off, people are going to begin to look at ways of building up impressive savings account at the critical age of 18-32. The easiest boost to savings rate would obviously be not having to pay college tuition debt. Given that FIRE is sort of a computer scientist's subculture, given that programming jobs usually pay the high enough salaries that permit early retirement, it's not going to be long before the FIRE "curriculum" not just becomes frugality, savings rates, VTSAX and index funds, and programming jobs, but free computer science education through your public library and OER. That's the most obvious conclusion I suspect we'll see in the FIRE subculture in the next decade or so. Now that people have realized early retirement is possible through computer science plus FIRE, avoiding college debt will result in people choosing not to enroll in college while 18-22 and instead study CS at home through the internet for the cost of four years of broadband. The benefits are truly remarkable: $1.1 million by the time you retire at 65 by compounding $60k, saved by avoiding tuition, for 43 years at 7% return.

The results are flabbergasting: Nearly everyone has the possibility to retire well at 65 just by investing the money at 22 saved by avoiding college tuition by studying CS at home using your public library, OER, and Library Genesis. With that sort of return, the benefits of being an internet-taught computer scientist will become more and more attractive to teenagers. Convincing teenagers not to go to college to study Computer Science requires pages like Mr. Money Mustache to show how important extreme saving is while you're young. As teenagers interested in early retirement become more and more committed to extreme frugality and saving at a younger and younger age, they will start to see that being a computer scientist doesn't require college but pays well and can be learned for free on the internet. I think these things will just sort of bubble to the surface and curriculums like Holm School based around OER will start showing their utility for the FIRE crowd. I'm going to keep working on this web pages to ensure it becomes a valuable source to people looking to become computer scientists for the cheapest route possible. When the stakes are as important as not having to work anymore and being able to pursue things that interest you, the risk of debt from college tuition will start to show itself as dangerous and more and more unattractive.

When the common ground in comparison is a career as a computer scientist, people will begin to realize that going to college actually costs you more money than not going to college. The typical belief is that going to college will earn you more money during a lifetime. But in the case of computer science, where online education in programming is ubiquitous and free, that simply won't be the viewpoint of computer scientists in the future. If you just invested the cost of college tuition and studied CS until you got a job using this website, you could be assured a comfortable retirement with hardly any work just on the earnings of that principal compounded over 40 years alone. When the stakes are that drastic, computer scientists who study FIRE will start skipping college in order to retire a millionaire.




## #30 - You Deserve to Go to College For Free

I was on the back porch thinking about how I was going to spend my Memorial Day. I first wanted to study PluralSight and .NET Core, then I wanted to go through college level math classes, then I wanted to conquer the Khan Academy curriculum, then I wanted to study MIT CS OpenCourseWare. My quest to make up for getting a liberal arts degree and study college level science is motivating but I'm having difficulty knowing where to start and it's a tad frustrating. But one thing struck me as I thought: You (the reader) Deserve to Go to College For Free.

I thought about my own life and how it took a turn for the worst when I decided not to go to the college that gave me a full ride scholarship and instead went with the more prestigious school that still gave me a "decent" scholarship. Instead of graduating from college with no debt from a state school, I decided to go to a private liberal arts college and graduate with $60,000+ in debt. What a horrible mistake that was. I even ended up going to that school that gave me a scholarship for summer classes and a year too, of course on no scholarship since I transferred, so the opportunity was completely a wash. While attending that state school, I wanted to pursue electrical engineering instead of the art history I was studying at the liberal arts college (the liberal arts college didn't have a computer science department). I didn't get into the EE department, though, since as a transfer who was deciding on what to pursue in the new flush options for science I had at a state school, I missed the deadline to apply. What a shame, being in the EECS department would have been quite an opportunity. Instead I studied music, which kicked off many years of studying Max/MSP, so at least I was coding in my music and studio art classes from that point on, which led me to eventually go back to college to study CS.

But I saw that indeed, I had wasted my opportunity to attend KU free and study a hard science, instead I attended a private college and studied the humanities. What a shame, because the first option would have prepared me very well for a career as a programmer while the latter option set me up for a career at Chipotle's, plus $60,000 debt. What in the world was I thinking?

But then I realized a few things. Probably if you want to be a programmer, you're a capable scientist who at the age of 18 is capable of scoring scholarships to local and state public universities. I think the college you choose should be made according to which one is the cheapest, and whether that cheapness will leave you with debt when you graduate. As computer scientists, I think you should work as hard as you can in high school studying SAT prep and taking AP classes, especially getting a National Merit Scholarship award, so that you can get a full ride scholarship to your state and local public university. The benefits are immense, especially if you study computer science.

College attendance is kind of like index funds and long-term investing. You want to go with the mutual fund with the lowest expense ratio. This expense ratio should be as lean as possible, and that's why most of us choose Vanguard. Vanguard has a .04% ER, whereas my TIAA-CREF account had a .3% ER for a S&P500 index. And of course, active accounts had something like .7-.9% ER. I think of private universities kind of like active mutual funds. They siphon off a significant amount of your profits, all while you assume all the risk and expenses. My private liberal arts education was like a 1.5% ER mutual fund, where my full ride scholarship was like Vanguard VTSAX. Of course, I was trying to outperform the market, and as we all know trying to outperform the market over long term actually returns smaller gains than if you had matched the market in an index fund. I wasn't buying and holding with a full ride, I was day trading with a liberal arts degree. What naivity I had! Chasing prestige was like chasing Past Performance as an indicator of future returns: Past Performance is meaningless and useless as an indicator of future returns! No wonder I got burnt, because I was gambling against the odds. The mutual fund company (the private liberal arts college) made a healthy profit at my expense while I experienced greatly diminished returns versus the market. Debt when young is a powerful force that works against you, and I took on quite a large sum trying to outperform.

I think preparation for college needs to be seen as sort of index investing: you live frugally to earn capital (i.e. studying for PSAT, SAT, AP classes, and class rank) and in return you earn a match of the market (a full ride scholarship to a state school). With zero debt, you can enter the workforce able to max out your 401k and IRA when young in order to gain compound interest for 35+ years. If you follow the active trading route, and go to a private liberal arts university (the enormous tuition is more like a higher ER), you probably won't even gain as much as what you would accomplish at the state school which you could have gone to for free. That's because $60,000 debt at age 22 is equivalent to $1.6 million dollars of lost earnings by age 60 had you invested that in a 401k and IRA with total market index funds instead.

You should always go for the cheapest university, no matter what the "prestige" of the university. College-level education is mostly self-education anyway, and there are diminishing returns on paying more for what accounts to an roughly equal product. Since you can download any science book ever published on Library Genesis, the quality of the library, for example, doesn't matter. We're now entering the weirdly utopian world that what qualifies as college-level resources for studying is mostly equal to all students in America. Chasing prestige is like trying to beat the market: In the long term, it's your lose of profit while the universities siphon off a third up to a half of your profits.

A lot of self consciousness might be the result of wanting to become a computer scientist. Students might think they don't deserve a full ride scholarship, and so they sign up for debt at a more expensive private university. I'm not sure. But you deserve to go to the college for free. If you're in high school, since college is mostly for 18-23 year olds, you should try to earn as many scholarships as you can. For older adults maybe looking for a career change or who never attended college, you should study online, a [$5200 F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html), or else selectively (CS only) at an affordable public university in your hometown. You should always go with what costs the smallest amount of money. There is no diminishing of quality when you choose affordability, online education is quite good in this day and age. Budget college might mean you don't even sign up for college, and just go to your public library to study their CS stack, mixed with online OER and OCW. But you should always choose the option that leaves you with the smallest bill.

You deserve to go to college for free, it is not a fluke. Anyone can budget their self education around a mix of brick-and-mortar and online education in order to maximize their education while keeping debt as low as humanly possible. Even if this means leaving your CS department early, only taking CS classes with no goal of earning a degree, or attending UoPeople and working 4 hours a week to pay the tuition cost.

Lot of hype surrounds college, and it's a powerful force that compells people who studied hard in high school to go deep in debt. Most people smart enough to get into a competitive private university are smart enough to pay debt off relatively quickly once they start their career. But that's not always the case, and getting left with nonbankruptable debt in the tens of thousands of dollars (these days its more like hundreds of thousands of dollars...) can truly impact your savings for retirement. In my opinion and experience, take the full ride scholarship even if it's to a less prestigious school. Prestige won't hold your hand once you get into the real world, and just because you don't have an expensive degree doesn't mean that you won't succeed as a programmer. Any shortcoming in your affordable/free university's CS curriculum and syllabi can be ameliorated with online OER and OCW, if not just YouTube. It's not even an honor to have graduated from a private university, you just kind of feel like a sucker when the degree doesn't result in any financial benefit but saddles you with debt. Buyer's remorse is something you won't have if you Holm School. There's a certain giddiness that comes from being frugal when you're young, in a way that mixed with responsible investing in vehicles like index funds, can set you up for a life of early retirement, general leisure, or even philanthropy.

You deserve to go to college for free. At the bare minimum, Holm School and other digital curricula like it (i.e. [functionalCS](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/) or [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com)), when mixed with Library Genesis, can leave you debt-free at 22 and employed, ready to hit up your Vanguard IRA plus your 401k to earn those 3200% 35+ year compounding returns. Don't squander the most opportune period of your life saddled with student loans. It's a risk and bad strategy. Go to college, whether real world or a digital 'unschool', for free.

## #29 - Youth is the Most Important Time to Avoid Debt, And That Includes Student Loans

Part of the digital Renaissance happening right now is that there is a complete inversion of the traditional rules with which most baby boomers grew up. What a world that you can teach yourself to be a programmer for $300 a year: PluralSight, Treehouse, Lynda. What a world that you can earn a computer science degree from UoPeople for $4000 total. And the rules have changed for other aspects of learning. Instead of teaching being a thankless, underpaid job, being a digital educator can net you millions of dollars. PluralSight's Scott Allen makes roughly a million dollars a year, because their proprietary platform enables thousands of concurrent students instead of just a classroom of learners, and so PluralSight's monetization rules enable Scott Allen to earn commissions of a million dollars. Sal Khan, rather than just teaching his immediate family in the hours after work, put his videos on YouTube and kicked off one of the largest free educational technology nonprofits in the world (Khan makes more than $300,000 a year). To not be on the cutting edge of educational technology is a grave disaster, because you basically put your financial future in jeopardy praying that the old rules appply (i.e. the prestige of a private university or the prestige of a tenure track position at a research university), but if you ignore all these crazy, radical new rules you're going to be missing out on some tremendous gains and advantages. I myself am concerned with outreach, so instead of volunteering to teach a handful of students at the public library or Boys and Girls club after school, like I want to do, I am instead focusing on an open source Github repository for the source of my efforts. Hopefully instead of reaching 20 kids, I can reach thousands. Those are high hopes, obviously, and I'm starting small digitally as well, but those are the possibility enables by the internet and digital technology like ipads and iphones.

Some of the rules around investing have changed too. Instead of putting your money in stocks, it is now common wisdom among the financial independence crowd to put your savings into index funds. This is relatively new theory, and index funds were marginal even ten or twenty years ago. It's quite unique to be alive at the time of a Renaissance, and concurrent with the Renaissance in digital education is the Renaissance in investing that comes along with modern personal finance blogs like [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com) aimed at computer scientists. If you follow the investment strategy of maxing out your 401k and IRA since the inception of your working life, having a savings rate of 50-70%, it's very easy to become a millionaire on a programmer's salary by the time you retire. In fact, just ten years of maxing out your IRA and 401k from ages 22-32 will result in your having more than 2 million dollars in your retirement account on just those ten years of savings alone (if you invest in total stock market index funds). The leverage you earn just by making really good choices in those ten years of your early working career can enable even zany ideas like early retirement. Financial independence is not hard, it's actually quite easy. The ongoing discussion around index fund investing is disseminating modern investment strategies on blog and podcasts on the internet, and to be unaware and uninterested in the latest developments is risking large amounts of "free" money earned through compounding for many decades.

Because your early life is a critical time period for financial security in later life, it is very important that you are very discerning when it comes to what you pay for in those years after graduating high school. Spending money on "investments" like private liberal arts college need to be analyzed extremely critically, especially since recent history has shown that the bloated cost of private tuition actually results in very low returns on investment. Many time you'll hear that college increases your earnings by $1 million over the course of your lifetime. What isn't said is that having a debt of $60,000 dollars at age 22 actually results in you paying your debt instead of socking the equivalent amount of money into index funds in tax-deferred IRAs and 401(k)s. If you invested $60,000 over the course of two years from age 22-24, instead of using that same amount to pay off debt, the compounding for 36 years from age 24-60 earns roughly $1.8 million dollars at 10% interest rate. So while you supposedly make a million more from having a college degree, if that college degree costs tens of thousands of dollars, you're sacrificing more than a million dollars too due to student debt during those critical early years.

Compounding interest is one of the most powerful mathematical concepts, which you can either use to your advantage by getting a college degree for zero cost, or it can be made your enemy by saddling you with non-bankruptable debt at the early stages of your career where earning potentials are their lowest. That's why college campuses are like mini feudal fiefdoms with castles. They are earning those fat compounding gains secured by investing at the age of 22, instead of you! You should put yourself in the estate's role, and find strategies to graduate from college debt free so that you can immediately max out your 401k and IRA each year upon starting your career. The simplest way is to go to your local public university in your hometown. The second easiest way is doing something equivalent to the [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html). The third easiest way is to study online for free using the Holm School Curriculum or at your public library. You can combine these tactics into modified strategies, such as taking as many CS classes as you can at your hometown public university, then finishing up your degree at UoPeople with transfer credits, and using your public library's Lynda subscription to supplement your studies rather than paying for Treehouse or PluralSight. The possibilities are endless, and the strategy needs to be crafted by learning Open Educational skills and study techniques, then combining them with the cheapest form of "college," whether that be just-CS-and-Math classes or whether that be UoPeople. What's most important is that goal of going to college for not more than what can be paid for working 5 or less hours a week at a minimum wage job. You want to be studying CS instead of working at a minimum wage job, especially because the return on investment is so high when learning to program affordably, so the tactic that minimizes the amount of necessary work in order to pay tuition so that you can graduate debt free is the best. This seems simple, and I'm not trying to be reductive. But many kids think that the expense of a degree signifies its quality, and therefore the most amount of work necessary to pay of your student debt is the best return on investment. Because we know about the opportunity cost of paying off debt instead of investing in index funds while you're young, we know this to be false.

Sometimes you may need your local public university as a sort of "booster" to your self-study "rockets." Obviously learning programming from scratch is most difficult at the beginning. By taking some intro to programming classes at university, you can learn the basics of programming so that you eventually reach the point that you are self-sustainable. At that point you can switch off the boosters, stop paying for university classes, and continue your study of CS online using OpenCourseWare and OER. You'll learn that once you can program the basics like data structures, that most advanced topics don't require in-person tutelage and that electronic educational resources are sufficient for your self study. As long as you're competent to pass your interview better than anyone else, you can break into a programming job without a degree. Fortunately the reward of studying affordably doubles up as you can "afford" more time to study. Instead of working, for example, because you don't have any costs, you can continue to study wherein if you were at university you would have to work at a job. Obviously the best situation would be to earn a programming internship while you're still studying. Then your time would be both studying and earning. Some internships might also cover the cost of your education.


Investing young is like free money. $10,000 invested in the S&P500 in 1980 would be worth $760,000 today. The irony of that statement is that that lifetime is the equivalent of a 22 year old investing that first year of employment, and in 2019 is the age of retirement. That should just exemplify how much college really costs. Paying $10,000 of student loans in 1980 would have "cost" you $760,000 today. That's the opportunity tradeoff that student loans force. It's amazing that in America we have set up a system that permits these financial burdens to almost inevitably and unavoidably foisted upon our youth. Just like feudalism was otherthrown with modern economic capitalism, so too the feudalism of mandatory college degrees will be otherthrown by the free market capitalism of online, open source educational technology. It will happen whether you pursue the new advances or not. What would be a shame is the opportunity cost of not pursuing the new economic system. You're throwing, quite literally, millions of dollars out the window by not pursuing the educational benefits available at just your public library and on github. 
 
The ability to graduate debt-free is a little miracle if you act appropriately and invest the equivalent money saved into a tax-deferred index fund-based savings account. It's almost like winning the lottery at the ripe old age of 60. Who wouldn't want to win the lottery at age 60? The question is, though, whether you can truly afford the "lottery mindset" that suggests by spending recklessly on "investments" with negative returns (like private liberal arts degrees), you'll strike it rich and score a multitudes-more successful career. Put the trust of your success in life on your individual skills, including the ability to self study online using free and open source educational resources with your sheer hard work and focused attention and effort, and you'll find yourself retiring successfully with very little investment (just a few years of a max-out 401k and IRA) once you begin your career as a programmer. By being suckered into an expensive, unaffordable, non-hometown college degree, you're making things much more difficult than what those shiny admission pamphlettes want you to believe.

The Educational Renaissance happening right now is that university-level training can be learned online for just a few hundreds of dollars a year, if not less. With free OER books and free OpenCourseWare classes, anyone can become a computer scientist for free. The only hindrance to your success is your own individual effort. The myth that you need an expensive degree to be successful in life can be counteracted by spending a few minutes with a compound interest calculator. You'll discover that youth is the most important time to avoid debt, and yes that even applies to student loans. Fortunately, there's no longer a Catch-22 that you need money to afford education, and you need education to earn money. Educational resources that are free are ubiquitous and prolific. Public libraries subscribe to digital resources on top of the sheer amount of free resources available on the internet. There are so many sources of learning that's it's almost impossible not to feel overwhelmed at the sheer amount of free tutorials and educational videos I have access to. While college isn't competitively priced, it would be foolish to turn my back on these inexpensive wells of knowledge and spend real money just for the sacred cow of tradition, "that's the way its always been done," and ritualistic formalism.

Fortunately for you a Renaissance is not a revolution. These choices of exercising frugality even while college age are not mandatory for every American. It's a choice, but one that I promote and educate about on this blog in hopes that you too can discover its benefits, in much the same way that my life has been aided by these resources plus my local public library. Everyone benefits from a Renaissance and the resulting scientific revolution that follows. Mr. Money Mustache and JL Collins's ["The Simple Path to Wealth"](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) have both been instrumental in getting me back on my feet after a disappointing twenties where I wasn't able to save. While I might not retire early, I no longer will be making investing mistakes like not investing in total market index funds and not maxing out my 401k and IRA. I will have a comfortable retirement now. I'm very happy that my Treehouse account that I get for free through my public library resulted in me learning about Mr. Money Mustache, from whom I learned about JL Collins. It's been a chain of successes that include me securing my career for just the cost of a handful of classes at my local public university. Now that I have a job, I can earn a master's through Georgia Tech's OMSCS degree for free thanks to tuition reimbursement. I'm locked in to a successful career thanks to my public library and open educational resources.

While I myself am not young, if I had been young I would have built for myself, at a debt-free level, a guarantee for a very successful retirement. Maxing out your 401k and IRA while young and living frugally is a ticket into a painless retirement. Not saddling yourself with student debt as a result of "lottery mindset" surrounding the hoopla of college degrees and their supposed valuation of millions of dollars, when free open source educational resources exist and are ubiquitous surrounding programming and computer science, is a great means of achieving financial independence early in life. Being a programmer for your career permits you to benefit from the huge success of open source as a movement. Open source educational resources are prolific in the computer sciences, and they're all available free online for one-click downloading. Raspberry Pis allow you the hardware necessary to learn to program for $35. It's a cultural mindshift regarding education that needs to be talked about and pursued. Thank you for reading Holm School, I hope I am convincing you that programming is a great means of saving money while you're young.


## #28 - You Shouldn't Spend More Money on Education Than You Do On Food Per Month

Here's a good rule of thumb:

You shouldn't spend more money on education per month than you spend per month on food. That means grocery-store food only, not even considering eating out at a restaurant.

That appropriately fits the budget of The F-You Degree. It's also conveniently an easy mnemonic.

Calculate your food budget per month. Do not spend more on that per month on education. Including college.

This is reasonable and doable with good, strategic choices. Not forgetting possibly using tuition reimbursement after you score a junior dev job through online learning.

I currently spend as much per year on education as I do on a month of food (not including internet, or $200 for a PluralSight account). My employer has offered to buy me a PluralSight account (ed: I got a Perlego account instead).

Don't get burned by education. Online education is so affordable, it's as cheap as grocery-store food. That's because online education is essential, like food, and so people will provide essential products affordably. Is water expensive? Is food expensive? No. Is online education expensive? No. Is in-person education expensive? Yes. Because it is not essential.

Don't overspend on education. Keep your budget equivalent to a whole food plant-based diet per month. In turn, you'll soon find after you score a job that you can teach yourself everything you need for even a fraction of this (supposedly) thin budget. There will be a point when you have so much knowledge for free, which provides you a job/income to such a degree that you save up when young and can retire early or have more time off work, that you have enough free time to produce free educational content yourself and share affordable educational content yourself.

## #27 - College is no longer the destination to learn how to code - the public library is

I made a listing today of a brief programming curriculum for everyone who has a Lynda subscription[ed: link now dead]. Fortunately most everyone who lives near a public library does have access to Lynda, or can drive for half an hour to get a card at a town that does. I recently discovered more and more public libraries are subscribing to Safari Books online, which means patrons will have a huge catalog to almost every O'Reilly and Packt book ever published for their self study. Rather than having to rely on the deadwood CS section stack, patrons can now access a huge digital archive of CS books. Perhaps you even live within range of a public library that subscribes to Treehouse.

In my opinion, anyone interested in learning how to program should enroll at their public library rather than a college. While not perfect, the online curriculums available through your public library rival academia. With hard work and dedication, you can teach yourself to program in employable stacks for free. Spending money to learn to program should order on the hundreds of dollars a year. At most, $1000 a year through UoPeople. Perhaps $200-300 a year for Treehouse or PluralSight. But there are ample study aids at your public library. For someone without any money, there are totally an equivalent amount of video tutorials at your public library to suffice to get you hired somewhere (where you can then take advantage of tuition reimbursement).

I believe that to be the case even without turning to OER or other free online learning. I think your public library, as long as they subscribe to Lynda or Safari Books or Treehouse, is sufficient to learn enough about computer science to pass a job interview. It's no shortcut -- you'll still have to spend many years in deep study. But for someone who views their economic situation such that they can't afford anything superfluous, a public library stack and esubscriptions should be enough to get you your first programming job.

And that obviously means you avoid debt. I think a computer scientist should, upon analyzing the CS EdTech landscape, realize that there are enough free learning resources to negate any need to ever go into debt or spend more than a couple hundred bucks a year. By avoiding debt, especially truly expensive debt like what college tuition is, you'll be able to save at your first programming job while you're young in index funds. Avoiding debt is a great strategy to prevent your youth earnings being siphoned away, so that they can compound in your favor instead of someone else's.

And it's now the case that public libraries cover all their bases related to computer science. Their stack, their Lynda/Safari Books/Treehouse subscriptions provide everyone an opportunity to study programming that rivals university. College is simply too pricey -- why go to university just for a degree when you can spend four years in a public library, learn just as much, and secure a job with zero debt? I think there are enough tutorials to learn an equivalent of college-level CS, and that's not even including OER and OpenCourseWare. That just means, when you include non-public library open source educational resources, that the curriculum is many times redundant equivalent online.

I would not be saying this ten years ago. But recent changes in public library esubscriptions that focus specifically on computer science enable vast new opportunities that change learning to program from being a hobby enabled by the library to being a potential career. When mixed with OER, the opportunity matches if not exceeds a college-level curriculum, because without debt you could possibly keep learning longer than if you were paying tuition, enabling more in-depth mastery of esoteric (but employable) subjects and languages. For anyone serious about self-education surrounding computer science, avoiding debt is the best strategy for enabling advanced study, since you won't have to immediately start working to pay off enormous student loans.

It would be quite advantageous as a society if 18 year old programmers, rather than enrolling at university, lived debt-free and studied using the free resources available from their public library. It's quite a unique accomplishment for many EdTech providers to enable a thorough training in CS online. MIT did it first with OpenCourseWare, then for-profit businesses did it with PluralSight/Treehouse/Lynda/Safari Books. A public library is dedicated to job training, and as such have focused their effort on building their programming educational resources. The for-profit educational resources, available for free for patrons, are a direct competitor to colleges. If your college is affordable, perhaps you choose to combine college and public library into an intense curriculum that all but assures you of a job. But if your college is expensive, by all means you should make use of what's available at your public library to at least get a first job, where with tuition reimbursement perhaps you can earn a few degree credits. But given that, thanks to public libraries, a college-level curriculum is available for free online, it would be foolish to take on debt just because "that's always the way its been done." Trust me, in ten years the public library will be the main location to learn to program, and all that expensive college stuff will be a funny historical note. My hope, of course, is that college become more competitive in their CS pricing, but I highly doubt that will happen.

My guess is, I am probably talking to some high schoolers, middle schoolers, or even elementary school kids with this post. Indeed, there is enough outreach these days that even kids learn to program. I know I was motivated to being programming in sixth grade on an old TRS-80 we had lying around my house, and I imagine many kids today also see the potential benefit in learning how to program. Fortunately, whereas colleges require you to be 18 years old, the resources available from your public library are available at any age. You can learn from your public library whenever you're ready to start! If you study the art of studying computer science, you could even gain something like a college-level equivalent of computer science training in high school. That's what Bill Gates did, and he was able to leave college and focus on his business selling BASIC interpreters. He took graduate level CS classes his freshman year. This is the sort of behavior that results in remarkable work and careers. It's a really good strategy to really rocket past what college offers you, especially if it's free. If you are competent in programming, and have studied CS through OER and OCW, then you could begin a job after completing high school if it is your main hobby. That's why, in my opinion, the public library is going to be THE place to study CS. Because there isn't an age restriction/mandate.

It's unfortunate that colleges no longer serve the interest of the community. They only serve the interest of their administrators who are looking for the largest paycheck. They saddle students with enormous loans, siphoning off millions of dollars in potential earnings from young professionals and compromise people's retirement. The public library lets you train for employment at any age, and leaves you without a single loan. It's really quite a remarkable invention. Things are only going to get better, in my opinion, as more and more affordable CS training companies get founded and are available at prices public libraries can afford. When mixed with free [online curricula](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html#further-studies) if not something like Library Genesis, the possibility for learning computer science outside of college, and at an ever-earlier age, holds radical potential. My hope is that in ten years Library Genesis will be made redundant and irrelevant, and the online holdings of public libraries surrounding science and programming are so overflowing that the day and age of $50+ programming books and tens of thousand of dollar college tuition loans is laughed at.

I know my public library enabled me to get my first programming job. Having a free Treehouse subscription taught me full stack web development, and I'll probably be working in web for the rest of my life. I recently passed "food FI" in my VTSAX investments after just a few years of working and having a 50%+ savings rate. Up next, rent FI! What a remarkable opportunity my public library has afforded me. I hope anyone, whether or not they can afford college/earn a full ride scholarship to one, can learn about how to study CS at their public library to enable their own career as a programmer debt-free. College is nice, but why pay tens of thousands of dollars (if not hundreds these days) for something that can be learned at your public library mixed with some online OER/OCW curricula. Sure, you might not get the respect deserved from some people, but those people live in the old world instead of the funky and amazing new world. Don't get pressured into going in debt when you know you can learn the equivalent for free online. Hopefully you've even used your public library as a learning resource while in high school, rather than playing video games or something, and can begin work at 18-22! Trust me, it is possible.

Keep following open educational resources and open courseware, and keep up to date with what's available at libraries. Demand for STEM resources is a top priority these days, and as such learning things like programming and CS are going to be prioritized by philanthropic institutes like a public library. Make use of the offerings! By avoiding debt while young, you could retire early or instigate a meaningful philanthropy career. [Good Will Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0) almost seems like prophecy these days, especially with the Renaissance surrounding the FIRE movement which has amazing potential for programmers. As the student loan crisis swells to record amounts these days, always keep abreast of a free, but just as good alternative: the public library. Now a days, you don't even have to leave the comfort of your home to get a free college education in CS. Don't turn your nose up at what you're being offered. Thank your fortunes you want to be a programmer and become one free!

The day and age of going to college to learn CS is over. While it's still a good option if you can go for free thanks to scholarships or can keep the cost competitively below the $1300 a year [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) tuition cost, don't believe that you must be at a college to become a competent programmer. What matters is your drive and initiative now that there is a [library](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books) of freely available programming texts -- not to mention Library Genesis  -- plus a ton of video tutorials thanks to Lynda and YouTube. Sometimes I regret not having studied CS when I went to college the first time, but now I realize my public library is a college degree in CS just waiting. I have every opportunity to catch up on what I missed, there's nothing that was available at college that I can't learn (for free) today. Basically I can get two degree (a liberal arts degree and a CS degree) for the price of one! Learning CS for two years at my local university and public library was a much better choice than going to graduate school in the humanities. All of this is possible thanks to the success of open source educational resources in computer science and public library's willingness to cover the gaps by subscribing to private tutorial sites.

I hope you learn to love to read OER, study with OCW, and learn with your public library's Lynda/Treehouse/SafariBooks subscriptions just like I have. My current education budget for my present job is $200 a year, and my job pays for it too. There truly is infinite possibilities for free CS education. The only limit is the amount of time you can dedicate to it per day. Take the time to learn the ropes on Holm School or elsewhere concerning open ed, and use the money saved to buy index funds! I kept my costs below $8000 at my hometown university to enable my first programming job, and today I am confident I could have done the equivalent with just a couple of hundreds of dollars instead, if not zero. If you find yourself with no money to pay for an education in computer science, the public library is where you want to go, not college CS departments!

## #26 - The limitless ceiling of intellectual pursuit is a false hope

Most smart people see college as their only hope of pursuing the intellectual life. This is because universities offer a million different graduate degrees that could sometimes occupy decades of time to achieve, and then after that is the promise to work at a university, where you could spend many more decades doing whatever you want under tenure. I am here to argue that this is a false hope that is a truly empty promise, and not a reason you should be willing to go tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at a young age.

If colleges truly cared about enabling you to pursue the intellectual life (for the rest of your life), which seems to be one of their main calling cards to smart kids who think they'll change the world with their inventions, then you wouldn't have to apply to graduate school. Just being accepted as an undergraduate would qualify you for the PhD track. But alas, to continue to graduate school you have to reapply to colleges, at which point your scholarships and funding are going to change. For some reason you even have to retake the SAT in the form of the GRE. Why in the world would you have to retake the SAT even after you've been selected to an undergraduate based on your scores. Is anything going to change? Are you smart at 18 but not smart at 22? Why can you be selected to do difficult academic work as an 18 but you have to reprove yourself at 22?

The simple answer is that by enforcing more hoops you have to jump through, colleges can make more money. The appearance of selectivity makes graduate school appear to be something prestigious, and colleges directly make money off notions of prestige. That's mostly how the private universities fill their endowment -- crafting ways to enhance and preserve their prestige. These GREs and graduate applications serve no purpose other than to filter out the students who are not wealthy from academia. If you believe that graduate school can be attended by nonwealthy students, you are truly delusional. Colleges barely give out wages or scholarships for graduate students, all but assuring the only people able to put 6-10 years of unpaid labor in pursuit of a PhD are those who are independently wealthy thanks to mom and dad. There is no reason to "cut" students out of graduate school. If universities truly desired the pursuit of scholarship and intellect, then every student accepted as an undergraduate would be able to pursue graduate study at the same institution after four years. But the hoops ensure that only the wealthy can continue on with academia.

This is more pronounced in liberal art departments, where most graduate students are trust fund socialists (lol) pursuing a career as a full time socialist in a liberal arts department after earning their degree. I'm not going to talk about that here. Instead, I want to argue that even in computer science, graduate school is still only for those independently wealthy. The filtering of poor students is a great way to preserve prestige, because "success" in the world is all but assured to kids who have wealthy parents who can pull strings to get their kid employed somewhere that pays well. If STEM jobs that pay well are only available to students who have graduate degrees, then it make sense that those who will be successful in getting those jobs will be students who have wealthy enough parents to fund a graduate school stint. You can see this in the recent bribery scandal. Wealthy parents will pay any amount to ensure their precious baby succeeds in academia. This obviously manifests itself in the way graduate school is functionally limited only to students with wealthy parents, who can pay for 10 years of volunteer labor (if not sometimes including actual tuition).

You might not believe me, but that's why I'm writing about academia. All your professors in nice private colleges will be people with PhD from nice private colleges. The way they were able to get those nice private college graduate degrees were because their parents were rich enough to pay for their graduate school. If you don't understand this, then it is likely you are going to be one of the middle class students who goes to a private college and then finds that their hopes of pursuing the "intellectual life" is promptly aborted by all those professors with nice private college graduate degrees. Those nice private college graduate degrees, which are required to teach at nice private colleges, are not going to be available to you. Either you'll be bad enough grades, you won't score high enough on the GRE, you won't be able to afford graduate school tuition plus rent, or you simply won't get accepted in lieu of a more wealthy applicant. You might go heavily into debt to attend an expensive college because you think you'll be able to study advanced topics that you can't get at other colleges, but if you aren't extremely wealthy you'll find a PhD impossible to get.

Colleges purport to be a place where you can pursue a lifetime of intellectual accomplishments. This isn't the case, and shouldn't be a reason that you're paying tuition and going into extreme debt at a young age. The life of the mind, when possible thanks to a private college graduate degree and securing a tenure track position, is so rare that you're practically gambling with vast amounts of some for what amounts to a pipe dream. If college were truly about training a kid for advanced study, they wouldn't cost anything if you're poor and they would allow graduate school to be immediately followed up with after undergrad. But they aren't, and it's setting you up to get burned if you're naive to think you can succeed in academia without great wealth. The sad truth is academia is only for wealthy families. Please don't think that you can sidestep this, this sad truth is true regardless of where you go. It permeates every level of academia, from school to actual jobs. Your graduate degree is just a certification that your parents are wealthy, it is not a certificate of accomplishment or originality or intelligence.

Of course, being a professor means you're super intelligent, right? Guess again. Now a days it is mostly a certificate that you're a trust fund socialist. Intelligence doesn't mean anything when graduate school is only available to the rich. Being a professor means your mom and dad were able to fund years of unemployment as well as excessive private school tuition. Again, I emphasize, if PhDs were actually a meritocracy you would be accepted into graduate school when you were accepted into your undergraduate university, and you'd have the total fee up front right then and there to comparison shop. The idea that graduate school has to be "earned" after undergraduate, which is also "earned", is just a farce that weirdly preserves society's impression of what is prestigious or not, while also ensuring that colleges make serious mooolah off everyone unaware of the truth.

Many smart poor or middle class kids think college is the only way they can spend their life pursuing science and academic inquiry. So they enroll in college STEM departments, paying outrageous tuition costs, only to find the only students that succeed in academia are kids of the rich. So they're filtered out of academia as soon as they achieve the academic level of study that could be accomplished for free at a public library. Instead of going to a public library or online using OER/OCW and learning to code for free, they believe that a long life of academic inquiry at the university lies ahead of them. Instead they get saddled with $60-240k worth of debt for a product/education that costs $0 at the public library. Colleges get rich while the majority of students suffer. Of course, they'll get bad grades throughout undergraduate, which they'll account to "just not getting computer science, I guess," but the truth is their grades reflect their mom and dad's wealth. Computer science is so easy it can be self-learned at a public library. You do not need to pay expensive tutors with PhDs from Ivy League schools to teach you how to code.

Of course, when you tell someone their best chance for success lies in spending two to four years at the public library learning how to code and then getting a junior dev job somewhere, they're going to tell you how much more enticing is the possibility of being a forever-academic at their chosen university. Sure, a life dedicated to being a thought leader certainly seems better than the assurance of a junior developer position. But the assurance of a successful career in academia is a pipe dream, you have a very low chance of getting one. Though "a junior dev job" isn't nearly as sexy as "being a professor at Harvard," it actually quite pratical, rewarding, and still holds quite a lot of potential for serious intellectual inquiry. I doubt anyone will believe me though, and so 18 year olds keep entering the meat grinder of academia in pursuit of CS degrees. I'd love to get paid to study computer science. But tell me, when was the last time you paid someone (who wasn't a relative) to study computer science? Probably never. And that's why your chances of getting paid to study computer science are similarly a pipe dream, and unrealistic, and not worth the massive student debt that comes when you gamble your retirement in turn for a shot at it.

Tell a kid to aim low, and you're accused of being a fascist. But tell them they'll be able to pursue science, in the most pure form, for the rest of their life, and then not deliver, and you're a "nonprofit." Give me a break. Academia only exists to feed off the culture of prestige that follows massive amounts of independent wealth. It is not meritocracy. Actually getting that junior dev position then working your way up the ranks is meritocracy, and probably the most realistic manifestation of what a meritocracy is and should be. But that's not what is perceived as a meritocracy these days. Instead, academia is viewed as the one true meritocracy. And academia pumps out propaganda that [coding jobs aren't meritocracies](https://postmeritocracy.org/) (lol) and instead you should just keep taking on those massive tuition fees without any means to pay for them as you pursue the life of the mindz0r.

Colleges aren't a limitless ceiling of intellectual pursuit. You won't keep rising through the ranks based on your hard work and great brain for the rest of your life, until you earn that Nobel you so richly deserve. You'll instead be shat out of the runnings as early as physically and emotionally possible, with zero refund on your student loans for all those false promised of PhDs and tenured jobs.

The sooner you realize when you're signing up for student loans, you intelligence isn't going to play any part in your resulting succeed, the more you stand to profit. I hope this website tells a bit of the truth behind academia, and you learn some meta-educational ways in which you can study undergraduate-level computer science for free. Though some might say, "I want to go past just undergraduate level, to a MASTERS and a PHD and BEYOND!", the chances are you won't get that opportunity anyway. It's easier just to work your butt off at the public library and secure a junior dev position for zero debt, than pursuing a false hope of limitless intellectual inquiry that the university falsely promises. I'm not even sure why, at this point, people would even morally respond to a system as corrupt as academia when the public library is free and available to anyone at any age and at any income level. Why people continue to choose the university, only to get burnt repeatedly, is beyond me. But then again, I did the same... but now I see that the public library is neutral good whereas the university is chaotic evil.

Don't gamble with vast sums of money as you pursuit the honeyed lies told by university that you'll easily become a graduate student if you attend their college, then work hard, etc. etc. It's actually just a rich clique, where you aren't invited but they'll still gladly take your money as you try in vain. If college actually gave a crap about training future leaders and thinkers, you'd be accepted into the PhD program when you applied as an undergraduate.

Of course, now with Library Genesis and Sci Hub even graduate-level intellectual pursuits can be attempted by anyone with an internet connection. Nothing prevents you from reading the latest research after work from your junior development job. You can still follow whatever computer science topic catches your fancy AFTER earning a steady paycheck. Don't think you can put the life of the mind before the paycheck, that's where you wind up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. I would suggest becoming financial independent by working your way up from a junior developer position, all while keeping a 50-70% savings rate and investing in tax-deferred index funds, and then becoming a full time researcher after retiring early in ten to twenty years. Nothing stands in your way doing that thanks to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis and the resources offered by your public library. That's true democratic education: debt-free and restrictionless, and actually earning a nice profit based on individual work and effort. The rest is false hope.

## #25 - Educational Costs in 2019 for CS Should Be on the Order of Hundreds of Dollars, Not Thousands

If you are sort of oblivious to the power of the open source movement, then look no further than the fact that Microsoft is now an open source company. Most of their new products are open source licensed. If even Microsoft can embrace open source, you know that open source has become the defacto license for contemporary software producers. If you are not working with open source in 2019, you might just be a dinosaur on the path to extinction.

One of those dinosaurs is academia. Despite MIT's OpenCourseWare platform being released in 2002 and having a few other colleges follow suit, there has been no widespread adoption of open source in colleges. If classes were truly open source, colleges would convert lecture halls into recording studios and livestream and archive almost all lectures made in them. Yet there are few colleges who build modern lecture halls to have their primary purpose to be a recording studio for immediate uploading onto YouTube. Recording lectures is still "too expensive," "too time consuming," "too intrusive." Nearly zero college classe are "flipped," in which the professor records their lectures in a digital recording studio (which can be watched by students any time on hopefully a free and open video hosting service like YouTube), while the classroom time is spend on discussion and socratic seminar instead of lecture. Both circumstances prioritize the digital recording studio videos published publically, whether individual or in a large lecture hall, but these course constructions are the exception rather than the rule. Colleges just aren't embracing open source. This makes sense when colleges still have market demand due to the only truly open source educational platforms being computer science focused, instead of other hard sciences or the liberal arts. If you want to study anything other than CS, you have to go to university, price be damned.

But if you are entering the field of computer science, there is a plethora of open source educational resources. These are usually free, and cover many years of top tier study. Take freeCodeCamp, for example, if you want to learn web development. If you want to study some proprietary CS video tutorials, these only cost a couple hundred of dollars a year. Mixing a cheap proprietary platform with free OER/OCW allows for in depth study for just a few hours of minimum wage work: the rest of your time can be spent studying towards that first programming job. That's not even including your public library's possible subscription to books and video platforms like Lynda, Treehouse, or Safari Books (not to mention their physical CS stacks). The fact is, you can cover most of your bases regarding learning with platforms that cost a couple of hundreds of dollars a year. If you can't afford that, you can focus on free resources. But all this is possible due to books and videos being open source licensed.

Books are rarely open source licensed, but I think that will change in the future. Again, it seems the only authors who open source their books are CS book writers. While I think eventually more and more authors will open source their books, for now I'm amazed by the multitudes of open source CS authors. With platforms like [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books) these open source CS books can be catalogued and easily accessible for a modern implementation of a digital public library. These books require no monthly subscription fee. They are essential free college textbooks. In a world of $200 textbooks for intro college courses, they are a swift punch in the face. The question is, are there free lectures on the books which can supplement for the actual professor's lectures?

This is where you have to take a substitution. Instead of having lectures over a certain OER book ([though those certainly exist](https://cs61a.org/)), you have to fudge together usually an OCW lecture on a proprietary textbook while studying OER instead. It's a sacrifice but one that will change as colleges embrace OER textbooks. If they don't, they'll eventually get replaced by affordable CS platforms (especially when the cost of a single textbook for a semester-long class would cover a year of study on one of these platforms, not even considering tuition on top of it). Would you rather spend $200 on a single textbook for an intro class (this is a little more than how much Liang's Intro to Java textbook costs new, for example), or get a whole year of PluralSight/Lynda/Treehouse/SafariBooks? Books aren't that great versus a huge library of programming tutorials!

Regardless, OER and OCW when mixed with affordable online learning platforms is a powerful combination that can suffice for modern training for just a few hundred dollars a year. Considering a single class at a public university that costs $1000 could fuel five years of learning on one of these platforms, it is almost absurd to assume colleges can compete with their course offerings. The thing that keeps people going to college, however, is the fear that they won't succeed as a programmer without a degree certificate. Fortunately the trend of open source becoming the dominant paradigm of computer science will most likely correspond with a lessening of the prerequisites for a junior developer job. The good news is that computer science jobs are going unfulfilled, and unemployment is at record lows, so the ball is in your court regarding getting a foot into the tech industry without a degree. Take your chances, but plan strategically so you will succeed: catalog your code on github, study what a good CS resume looks like, and study your ass off. Not getting a degree is not an excuse to study less: obviously you need to study even harder if you're not getting a certificate to remain competitive in the applicant pool. But in my opinion, saving money by learning online prepares you for a lot of success in your life if you focus on achieving frugality and financial independence while young, taking advantage of the fact that you won't have loans to pay off when young and can invest in index funds instead. I would much rather be financially independent than have a college degree in CS, and self-study of CS online is a great tactic.

The system is this: ubiquitous OCW, ubiquitous OER, ubiquitous public library resources, ubiquitous affordable proprietary learning platforms. The system lets you study your ass off every hour of the day for a couple hundreds of dollars a year. There's no dearth of study resources in the computer science, and people need to grok that going into debt to learn to program and the rudiments of CS just doesn't make any damn sense just for a paper certificate. Being financially independent is much more rewarding that having an expensive piece of paper. Especially when most programming jobs will pay tuition reimbursement! Teach yourself to program for a couple hundreds of dollars a year for four years, get a junior dev job, then get an undergraduate and graduate degree (paid for by your employer). Going into debt is risky and just a bit over-optimistic when your retirement returns for your 401k and IRA, if invested in index funds starting at age 22, has a 4200% return by the time you're 60. Spending that kind of money on a college degree when the OER/OCW system is so ubiquitous is a relic of the past. People will learn about the difficulties of CS degrees as financial independence / early retirement (FIRE) gains popularity among the CS crowd (as [Mr. Money Mustache already has](https://mrmoneymustache.com)) and the principals just become mainstream to computer scientists, since they fit so well together.

When online learning costs just a few hundred dollars a year and teaches roughly an equivalent amount when mixed with OER or public library books, the choice is obvious for computer scientists: Educational costs for learning computer science should never exceed more than a couple hundreds of dollars a year. You could probably even find an internship that pays for your PluralSight/Treehouse/Lynda/SafariBooks account on top of a hourly wage if you just ask and explain yourself. Companies get tax breaks for tuition reimbursement, so they usually offer some sort of benefits package for full time employees and even smaller gifts like PluralSight accounts to interns who don't qualify for benefits. Use their tax advantages to educate yourself so your resume is bulletproof from a young age. When coupled with zero debt, you'll find yourself in a decently paying junior dev job with your future education costs covered. Considering you've read Holm School and are savvy enough to know how to keep your educational costs to just a couple hundreds of dollars a year, let their benefits package be the "maximum" you're willing to spend on CS. You could totally splurge on things like a useless CS undergraduate degree! Why not? Work your way to a CS degree, don't CS degree your way to work. The advantage is financial independence!


## #24 - Living at Home For Four More Years Isn't That Bad

A lot of people think turning 18 means independence, at last. I find that ironic since most 18 years have roughly enough savings to maybe pay for 3 months of living in an apartment. For some reason, going into debt to live in an apartment you have no means to pay for, _for four years_, is viewed as a wise decision. The cost of living in a dorm is on average $10,000 a year according to google. It's nice that that includes food, but considering I've learned how to spend $200 every two months eating WFPB, I think in most cases paying that much for board is quite a rip off. When including $200 a month for food, you are basically paying $633 a month for a tiny apartment you have to share with at least one other person. This seems like a ridiculous deal, when living at home is free.

I recently had to pay off a leasing contract when I left early for a new job in my hometown. I had to spend roughly $5000 for the remaining months. What a horrible feeling! I was paying a lot of money for a good I wasn't even receiving. Yet this is what 18 year olds do, not for five months, but for 48 months when they go to college! BEWARE! THERE IS NO BONUS WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU GRADUATE. No one is going to pay off those 48 months of unpaid rent as a reward for getting a degree. Instead you'll be saddled with an IMMENSE debt when you're only 22.

And I'll tell you, there is nothing so essential from 18-22 that living at home doesn't suffice for human happiness. At age 22 you are still basically a kid, and living at home from 18-22 _thus isn't that bad_. You want to live at home when you're still young, not when you're old, and so 18-22 is the perfect age to live rent free at home instead of entering a non-bankruptable contract equivalent to 48 months of rent backpay (and that's not even including tuition!). Dorms aren't any cheaper than apartments, and it's common knowledge that apartments are _expensive as hell_.

Spending money you don't have is a recipe for disaster, and when I look at the EdTech landscape in 2019 I can see the potential to never go into debt for a college degree if you use philanthropic endeavors like UoPeople or OMSCS for a degree, while utilizing the public library and online educational resources like OER, OCW, and miscellany like Library Genesis. It's a remarkable world, a four year bachelors of science [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) that you can pay off as you go with the equivalent of 4 hours of minimum wage work a week. Graduating with zero debt and all the skillset as any other programmer, to get a junior dev tech job that will PAY FOR YOUR RENT (instead of you bottom lining it!), while also enabling you to save 50-70% of your salary in tax-deferred and non-tax-deferred index funds. Starting at age 22 with zero debt and a positive cash flow is what enables early retirement or financial independence.

Living at home and studying online sounds like anathema to all those kids who have been told by college recruiting offices that "normal" kids move to a different state and live in dorms (or rent houses/apartments). That's simply crazy, and as someone interested in personal finance I'm amazed that this is what passes for culture in America. Going into debt while young is dangerous. I do not consider education a "good debt" when because of open source all the learning you need _for life_ (not just age 18-22) is available online for at most a couple of hundreds of dollars a year. As [Ryan Carson](https://medium.com/views-from-the-treehouse/your-college-degree-will-cost-you-2m-c20c2570bd57) and [myself](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-05-44-Reasons-Not-To-Go-To-College-To-Study-Computer-Science.html#31---retire-a-millionaire-by-skipping-college) have pointed out, for all those assurances that college grads earn a million more in their lifetime, the actual cost of college debt takes away more than a million dollars of possible returns of index funds.

Personally, if someone told me you could have a million dollars just to live at home from age 18-22, I would scoop that up. I imagine most people would. Yet that's the opportunity cost a high percentage of 18 year olds give up when they sign up for a dorm contract at an out of state college. I promise you, colleges are extremely predatory. They are not in the business for promotion of knowledge in American society. They might have been during the age of the Enlightenment or whenever when colleges were invented and founded, but that is not their modus operandi anymore. They are extremely predatory -- just look at the irony that college debt is non-bankruptable. If a college education were so valuable to society, why is its cost non-bankruptable? Sounds like loan sharks with their metal pipes coming for your kneecaps more than a societal blessing. Yet people think colleges are totally benevolent, and they are more than happy to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a liberal arts education. This is so remarkable to me because colleges aren't even open source. There's nothing about them that is open source. Their libraries usually have locks (card entries) on them, keeping out non-students. Nothing is "forkable," nothing is copyleft, and nothing is viral. It's a relic of the past that worked before the internet, but since the invention of the internet has become involved with thuggish tactics to preserve their prestige, public persona, and especially coffers.

Colleges were invented long ago, coming of age during the Enlightenment, but their replacement was invented when ARPAnet came around, and had their coming of age during the 'oughts when Google developed the infrastructure for free video hosting using a nonintrusive ad model. The modern internet in 2019 is the replacement of college. While people use to say "I'm going to college," modern people should say "I'm going to the internet" when referring to the same thing. Going to college in the day of the internet is like willingly walking into a tarpit. The tar is the fact that college debt is non-bankruptable thanks to American politicians. I believe it's the only debt that is non-bankruptable. Look at that fact and identify it as a virtual tarpit. If you touch this plague that is student debt, you are going to get infected. While people think of bubonic plague as the defining trait of the medieval ages, I think centuries from now people will look as college's behavior after the maturity of the internet as the defining trait of our age. It's an economic plague rather than a biological plague, but people are certainly still being hurt. It is a travesty.

I present a bizarro new world being created thans to the invention of the internet. Whereas learning at the public library twenty years ago was used as a [punchline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0) by the proto-frugal, the new frugality offered by the internet is finding its home not in the university but the public library. Public libraries are now offering free archives of books and videos digitally through their subscription platforms. Whereas public libraries were previously repos of light reading for pleasure, the public library is now the replacement for the university. Instead of going to university, people will now go to the public library to earn their "degree." Though as of this moment, there are no real degrees, in the case of computer science it doesn't really matter because knowing to program is all you really need in order to secure a job. Computer scientists earn their job by exercising their learning and scholasticism. It is not purchased at a university for tens of thousands of dollars. Learning and scholasticism will take place at the public library using their online services as well as the general internet. A college equivalent in computer science will be brainlessly accessible thanks to video curriculum detailing how to program and nearly a complete archive of every computer book ever published. These levels of resources won't be offered at universities, ironically, instead they'll only be offered by public libraries. As more and more people discover these resources and decide that their cost (free) is much more competitive than university, what use to take the lone genius of Will Hunting will become standard behavior in America.

Where European countries have free college, in America we will have free public libraries. In every region throughout America. No matter where you are located, you will have access to an "MIT-level" education in computer science. This will happen because the very internet that makes it possible foretells that in the future all workers will have to know how to code in order to earn a salary. This isn't a bad thing, but is actually awesome because as more jobs require code, it means more things in America will be _free_ or virtually free, reproducible, open source, and widespread. Rather than being limited in what companies can produce, companies will create open source solutions to the problem of scarcity that defines free market capitalism. Open source is the virtual manifestation of free market economies, and is capitalism evoked. That's because the supply and demand curve for open source software and hardware is "free for everyone, everywhere." Public libraries are now on the exponential curve of Moore's Law, while colleges are not but are BigO of n. Public libraries are open source and electronic, but colleges are deadwood and scarcity-driven. Just think about the model of "prestige" that the entire concept of modern private colleges runs on, and you'll see that scarcity is the curve that colleges lie on. Prestige will and always will be non-Moore's Law. But open source public libraries are definitely on Moore's Law, and we'll see their ubiquity and affordable get crushed in the oncoming decades. I'm willing to bet on it (i.e. why I'm creating a nonprofit to fund computer science education at my local public library).

Would you move to a different state to attend their public library? Haha, of course not. What a laughable idea. You would stay at home and attend your own local public library. That's the reason why staying in your family home from age 18-22 and Holm Schooling is such a good idea, because everything is available at your local public library. Whereas previously you were defined as lucky if you had a public university in your hometown, now you will be defined as lucky if you have a good public library in your hometown. "College Town" as a word will be replaced by "Public Library Town." Of course that's absurd, because every town is a public library town. And that's why public libraries are on Moore's Law and colleges are not. It is through this vector that college-level education in computer science will be exponentially more affordable than the alternatives. I believe this moment is now, but some will say it is in the oncoming decades. Nevertheless, I think it's safe to say it's a good use of time to start analyzing the true cost of a college education.

Part of that true cost is the mandatory purchasing of an apartment without any means of paying for it. 48 months of rent is a tragic burden that should never be foisted on a 22 year old. I think this can only be assumed to be happening because most 18 year olds have never had the requirement of paying for rent before, so they are oblivious to how annoyingly expensive it is. The alternative of staying at home and Holm Schooling is so attractive to anyone who understood the advantage of living at home while attending a local university. The advantage is doubled by avoiding tuition on top of avoiding rent. Having zero debt but the programming knowledge that comes from Holm Schooling computer science for four years allows you to pump your savings that you earn from your frugality into index funds, etc., which can compound for 40 years. When you mix zero debt with the magic of compounding interest, you'll be amazed at the results. The results in my own personal experience (which, I think I noted before, have been basically facilitated by Ryan Carson's products ([Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) and his "Educate Yourself" podcast) have been life changing, and sometimes I cry at how prosperous my life is thanks to the education I received from Ryan Carson and his team. I hope everyone can experience what debt free computer science education means, especially since it is so readily available (even though most people don't know about it) at places as simple as public libraries in your state. Or else online. It's all there for just a couple hundreds of dollars a year, at most.

Just like no one would pay for a high school education with public schools around, in the future no one will pay for a computer science education with public libraries and the internet around. It's _free_, who would go into debt for a public good?

So would you rather have a million dollars or a dorm room for four years? I'm making no guarantees, but the possibly is there for the wise to take. My suggestion: Live at home and study at Treehouse, Khan Academy, your public library, and Holm School computer science online. I think you'll be surprised at the results. At most you'll have spent a couple hundreds of dollars over the course of four years. The alternative, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of non-bankruptable money for a potentially useless diploma, seems to me the worse odds. And I'm a fan of good odds.

To add one last thing, as a vegan straightedger, I won't pay any mind to the whine that you can't drink/party at home. That's actually a huge benefit to living at home from age 18-22, especially to your account. Alcohol is dangerous/cancerous, addictive, and expensive, and in fifty years will be viewed with the disdain we currently hold towards smoking cigarettes for example (I'm nearly positive). If you are addicted to psychoactives, buy the placebo and wean. You shouldn't consume animal products and you shouldn't consume addictive psychoactives, in my humble opinion, though that's obviously not mainstream. Since when was Holm Schooling mainstream? Wife and child beating was mainstream half a millennium ago...

And as an addendum: If you are willing to put up with living at home for a few more years after getting your first job (if it's in your home town), you can really prepare yourself for a comfortable retirement. Saving the equivalent of $900 of rent each month and putting it into VTSAX at the age of 22-24 nets you something in the range of $1.1 million dollars for retirement at age 60 at 10% interest. Just living at home for three years after your first job can put a million bucks into your retirement. Seems like a pretty sweet deal for just three years of your time. I'm not advocating living perpetually at home, although in some cases that might actually work, but living at home while you're still just 22 years old pays off when the money saved can compound into hundreds of thousands of dollars for doing nothing than living in your old room for a couple of years. Personally I would do it if I had a good relationship with my parents and wasn't addicted to partying or whatever. Being "straightedge" involuntarily seems like a small sacrifice for a million dollars.

## #23 - If You Are Paying to Study Offline, You Are Probably Getting Ripped Off


Full ride scholarships are pretty rad, so if you get one anywhere I’d suggest you take it regardless of perceived prestige of the college. But if you aren’t lucky enough to get a full ride scholarship, I have to present the conclusion that if you are paying money to study computer science, you are probably getting ripped off. I consider “money” anything more than $300 a year. And if you are paying money for paper books, you are also probably getting ripped off.

I think of it like this: All it takes is one good recording of a computer science class and its lecture to be uploaded on the internet for everyone in the world to consume. That’s some ridiculous return on investment: For the cost of a professor’s salary for one class, plus some recording equipment, anyone in the world who is an English speaker can learn a full semester’s worth of computer science. That means for roughly $20,000, maybe 100 million people can benefit in the entire world for the rest of time. That means the cost you should be paying for that lecture is 20000/100000000, or 2 hundredths of a cent to pay for it. That can easily be paid for by just a single ad view, or maybe just a banner ad placed on a page. In my opinion, paying more than a cent for a class on computer science is getting ripped off. People sometimes pay $1,000 at a public university for a single computer science class, which is a 10000000000% percent markup. If I were selling a digital product for a ten billion % markup, I would be making gangbusters. And that’s what college is in the day and age of YouTube, it’s a gigantic racket that is totally obsolete by normal means of market competition. If there was a package of soap for $2 on the market shelf, and a competing brand for $200 million dollars for an equivalent package, people are willing purchasing – WITH NON BANKRUPTABLE LOANS – the $200 million dollar package of soap. That’s ridiculously amazing, and no wonder the student debt crisis is one of the biggest problems youth face in modernity. That’s because they’re purchasing – again, with NON BANKRUPTABLE LOANS – a product that is marked at a 10 million percent markup compared to its market competitor.

I mean seriously, people just need to meditate on the meaning of free video hosting and the ubiquity of high resolution cell phone video cameras. On those two inventions alone, paying tuition is dead in the water. A college course in computer science costs 0.0002 cents to consume thanks to YouTube. Maybe you haven’t noticed the complete revolution in society that happened as a result of the invention of the internet and modern computers? A good that people used to take out loans to purchase is now two hundredth of a cent. In my opinion, that’s a revolution. Yet everyone is apparently oblivious to it. People aren’t studying computer science any more than in the past. A discipline that invented the technology to do a feat like that isn’t viewed as probably the future of most everything important in civilization. People still aren’t studying computer science. CS still isn’t taught in elementary, middle, or even high school. The only people who learn to program before the first year of college are learners who teach themselves online. It’s a travesty that this occupation isn’t being promoted to most everyone capable, given that it’s return on investment appears to be ten billion percent.

I’m not complaining though. Because I know I’m right, and that free open source online education on computer science is the future. Once you spend a couple years studying CS online, you’re primed for a beginner’s job developing software somewhere. In a few more years of hard word and continued study, you’ll be prepared to invent the sort of technology that enables ten billion percent return on investment. I’m no mathematician, but multiple ten billion percent by ten million people or so who grow up learning CS for free online, enabled by technology like Raspberry Pis and public library computers for kids, and you’re getting a huge return on investment on that Educational Technology. If computer scientists keep creating inventions that reduce the price of consumer goods by 200 million times, the more people who are able to train themselves with free OCW/OER, lowering barriers to entry, will benefit society immensely. Maybe even a future without 40 hour work weeks! People won’t need to retire early because the burden of a job will be so low because consumer goods will be so affordable.

That’s the sort of future I’m envisioning by people learning computer science through Holm School. I’m willing to spend my time hyping and building up this project because the return on society as people learn to be expert coders for free online is basically incalculable. That’s why I’m not surprised public libraries, who function on the humanist goal of bettering society, are willing to spend the big bucks purchasing Lynda/Treehouse/SafariBooks subscriptions for their patrons. That’s what I mean by saying public libraries operate under Moore’s Law. I can learn modern full stack web development on my public library Treehouse and Lynda account for the cost of a computer and internet. That’s basically $2200 dollars over four years. A public college degree in CS, which costs the cost of a computer and internet plus $8000 a year tuition, totals $34200 over four years. That’s my public library delivering a 1555% reduction in my educational expenses. That’s an amazing service provided by my public library. Ten years ago that would have been impossible. College would have still cost $35,000 dollars. Now I can get a college-level education in CS for $2200. If that sort of reduction of the cost of a consumer good in seven years isn’t an example of Moore’s Law in action, then I’ll eat my hat. In the future, we’ll get even more computer science resources for free from our public libraries as more EdTech companies are started up and things continue to be digitized and book online cheaply according to Moore’s Law.

Moore’s Law is sort of the corollary to the magic that is compound interest. While saving while young can lead to an early retirement, EdTech being a product on Moore’s Law means the cost of education is going to soon be almost free. If you don’t realize this is going to be publicly accepted truth in just a few years, you’re probably being ripped off by a college somewhere. I’m not sure why people would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for an education they can receive for free in exchange for watching a few ads before videos. If you understand that a college course costs $0.00002 in the day and age of YouTube, you’re well on your way of incorporating that knowledge into a successful financial independence strategy.

That’s not even mentioning Library Genesis. I use to spend hundreds of dollars a year on purchasing books starting roughly at age 17, but now I haven’t bought a book in three years. The cost of my education with regards to purchasing book was reduced to the cost of my seven year old ipad and internet amortized. That, again, is basically Moore’s Law in action. If you are paying money to read computer science books, instead of reading them free on your ipad or laptop thanks to Library Genesis, you are probably getting ripped off. I realize I will probably not read more than one or two paper books a year. I’m okay with that, because I’m still reading roughly a hundred books a year for free. Those hundred books would have cost me probably $1000. The amortized cost is roughly a reduction of somewhere around 1000%. That again shows that a simple product of computer science reduced a consumer cost I was willing to pay to something around 1000% less expensive in a matter of three years time. The cost to publish a book, say $40,000, is divided by the possibility of ten million readers online. That comes to roughly $0.004. The cost to read a textbook, in the day and age of Library Genesis, is 4 tenths of a cent. That again can be paid with a simple ad view. 

All this is possible because digital public libraries are on Moore’s Law. Whereas the public library used to have to purchase a single copy for its local patrons to be borrowed one after another, now a public library can purchase a single digital copy and upload it to Library Genesis and the digital copy is available to every person with an internet connection in the world. Public Libraries no longer are physical, but digital. A digital public library serves everyone in the world, with costs that are basically $15 for an ebook read by a million downloaders, or $0.000015 of total cost for each reader to the library. Even better if that ebook is donated by a person who did purchase it, in which case the public library can deliver it for zero cost beyond its yearly server fee amortized by all users. Again, a cost that can be mitigated by a simple ad view by each patron.

A college class, when executed using YouTube and Library Genesis or through other public library services, roughly costs the expense of a single banner ad view, or maybe a video view. If you ask me if I’d accept a college education for the expense of a couple hundred ad views, I would gladly accept. And that’s what I’m doing/did. I paid for my college education in computer science (a really good degree with a good return on investment for the effort) with viewing a couple hundred ads as I went along throughout the years. I have no regrets about not being in debt. And neither will you.

If you aren’t amazed at the ability to download a book and read it on your ipad for free through the public library Library Genesis, you probably didn’t go broke at a point in your life purchasing books (whether for a college class or for pleasure). The fact that Library Genesis is paid for by a couple of banner ads when you download the book is truly amazing. That’s the power of open source licenses and the internet. If you aren’t creating products that are open source, you are never going to be competitive in the future markets. Not creating products with an open source license is akin to trying to take society off Moore’s Law, and all the benefits it affords. Moore’s Law is as magical as compound interest. To not open source your product, thus not placing it on Moore’s Law, is akin to not investing in index funds while young by avoiding debt, thus not placing yourself on the compound interest curve. Both are grave mistakes that belie a complete misunderstanding of the implications arising from the invention of computers in the forties. If you don’t acquaint yourself with computer science and open source license, and all that information is available for a couple ad views here and there, you’re not participating in civilization and civilization’s rapid growth thanks to Moore’s Law.

I hope as someone that understands compounding interest, you’ll be equally amazed by how open source licenses are basically compound interest for the benefit of society. That’s because open source is a really good implementation of free market capitalism, which is a bedrock of liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is sort of endeavor that humanists undertake in order to invent new ideas like open source licensing. It’s probably the case that “the public domain” [actually invented liberal democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcvd5JZkUXY) as we know it. As more people abandon the counter-enlightenment for liberal democracy, aided by modern technology and science and the pacifying effects of free markets, more people will abandon the prevailing counter-enlightenment ideology that copying is theft, whereas open source licensing teaches that [copying is not theft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4). “Copying is not theft” is a central tenet of free markets, in my opinion, as well as liberalism as a movement. People harbor conservative ideologies in various ways, but copyright is probably the most prominent conservative/counter-enlightenment paradigm throughout the world. That’s why open source is so important to be taught, because it is a return to the concept of the public domain from which liberal democracy sprung. Totalitarian ideologies always tries to shit on free markets, since that’s probably where totalitarian ideologies have the most potential for impact on people’s brains, but as a liberal humanist, I will do my best to promote the public domain through Holm School.

So, in conclusion, if you are paying to study offline, you are probably getting ripped off. I think people should be a little more aware of where they’re being taken advantage of, because cognition of exploitation has lead to some really great things like liberal democracy and free markets. I think allowing people to be ripped off and not run a social campaign in some form is a little complicit. That’s why I’m working on Holm School to promote the message that you can get a college-level education in computer science for the cost of watching a couple hundred ads over the course of a year. It’s so non-intrusive anyway, it’s a good example of how Moore’s Law/Compound Interest really benefits basically everyone in modern free markets. Civilization has benefited immensely from technology, and the burdens and stresses faced by modern people will continue to be alleviated by new inventions which make expensive consumer goods practically free. In my opinion, one of those consumer goods is now computer science educations, which has been reduced by a factor of ten billion percent. That sort of low cost can be covered through a simple ad on the webpage. It’s quite a remarkable system and I hope it thrills as many people as it thrills me.

## #22 - The Radical Potential of the Digital Public Library

There is something interesting about books, which a public library practically specializes in owning. A book is ripe for easy digitization. If the book wasn't published recently enough to just convert the source word document into a pdf or epub, then the pages can be scanned one by one by just one location in the entire world then uploaded. This doesn't have to be done by every library anywhere, but only one location. That keeps the cost of digitization relatively low for the social reward of digitized books. The potential for disruption due to this ease is apparent when one looks at the effect the creation of .mp3s had on music stores. Most of them closed. Nobody purchases CDs anymore (and if they do they consume them by immediately ripping them into mp3s on their home computer). Music is consumed by a few apps -- Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, and Amazon Digital Music. Rather than a chain store in every town hawking CDs, music is entirely online. You no longer have to drive somewhere, in a car or on the bus, to purchase anything. It's all done through digital subscriptions to your credit card. Rather than being expensive, it's amazingly affordable when you consider you have access to most every song ever written for the equivalent cost of a single lunch once a month. Rather than having a CD collection in a binder in your car, you have an "mp3 collection" of every song ever written. It's quite remarkable and it only took about 13 years after the appearance of the first portable mp3 players to achieve.

Books, though a little slower than the ease at which CDs can be converted into mp3s, are also being digitized and hosted online. Though there is no monthly subscription to the entire human archive yet, it will probably arrive within a decade through the same companies as mp3s (google, apple, amazon). It's no surprise to anyone that's had to pay $200+ dollars for a college textbook that the book industry is particularly resistant to digitization efforts -- the Author's Guild suing google books, etc. -- but eventually reality will force its way in and books will be available with a subscription. There are some efforts like Safari Books Online to have a large archive of computer science textbooks available at roughly $200 a year. This is kind of like the digitization of movies -- whereas there is no one service to subscribe to every movie ever made for a monthly fee, instead there are a ton of individual smaller archives usually hosted by a publishing outfit that you can access for a monthly fee. These small fiefdoms of digitized media are a final stand against the ultimate product -- all movies ever created for a monthly fee -- that will inevitably come about some time in the future. It's kind of like how Spotify replaced the iTunes store, even though the iTunes store did the hard work of convincing Music Labels to digitize their libraries. First it's little fiefdoms, then comes the ultimate library when all the fiefdoms are consolidated into a single subscription.

I talk about this in hopes that you become optimistic about the future of public libraries. Digitized books are available very inexpensively, and though at the moment public libraries are forced to subscribe to small archives like OverDrive/Libby and Hoopla, prices for ebooks will continue to drop as subscription archives increase their holdings as well as face competitors will larger libraries and more efficient price models. Public libraries will realize their impact will increase with the offering of a large archive of digital books, which don't require actually driving to the library and checking one out, but just a tap of a button on an ipad. Not spending the electricity to drive to the library is a much better option than checking out the deadwood copy. Digitized books aren't limited to a single copy (though subscription models prevent infinite checkouts and are restricted by the library's purchase price for now). For example, though products like OverDrive prevent checking out more copies of a book than the library purchases, content platforms like Lynda have no restriction on any sort like this on their library's tutorials. I imagine this will become standard in the not too distant future -- restricting digital copies is silly when it's literally digital. Not having to get yourself to a library is a golden opportunity because you can sit at home at not get eaten up by the sunk cost of the effort it takes to check out a deadwood book, so you can quit reading and effortlessly return it if the book turns out not to be good. It's small benefits like this that compel public libraries to focus more and more on digital books rather than paper. The trend will obviously continue.

Also worth noting is that ebook readers, which when first introduced were expensive and not very user friendly, are now ridiculously affordable, use a universal operating system like android or iOS, and can be purchased used to get even better deals. The ability to read hundreds of books a year digitally is worth the purchase price of a new or used iPad, for example. My iPad is seven years old and still works perfectly fine for all my reading and surfing needs. Fortunately books take almost zero computing resources to consume, so you don't have to have the latest hardware to "run" a book like you do a video game or something. You can purchase an ebook reader once a decade, for a hundred bucks! And then get an infinite amount of free books! How friggin amazing! And you don't even have to drive to the public library! I haven't set foot in my public library in four years, yet I consume their subscriptions nearly every day of my life. I can't help but think that the gas/electricity I save pays for my once-a-decade iPad purchase. I also never have to worry about late fees for missing the return deadline.

Digitized books are simply an amazing product, I even think they're more revolutionary than mp3s (and I was a huge fan of mp3s, --r3mix and --alt-preset standard 4 life!). Getting to read books, which I used to overdraft my debt card accidentally while in college when buying, can now be read for free on my iPad. I read about a hundred books a year, averaging one during the week and one or two on the weekend. Rather than going broke to read, I now pay zero dollars and still consume all the latest trending books I want to read. It's a remarkable system for the cost of internet and an iPad each month. It almost assures the cost of retirement will be much smaller than anticipated, because I will be able to entertain and educate myself for free every day of my retirement. I read books instead of watch movies (though I get a free Kanopy subscription through my alma mater library as well as the next town over's public library), and I don't play video games, so my main activities when I'm not working is reading books or watching video tutorials on programming. In this way I've been able to spend exactly zero dollars on entertainment since getting my first programming job. Books are many times over the best way to spend time, and rather than being limited by costs, I'm now limited by time in how many books I can read each year.

This is the radical potential of a digitized public library. You don't even have to leave your couch to check out the next book. When I can read nearly every magazine I want to read thanks to my public library's Flipster subscription (except Harper's, alas), I save a ton of money. When I don't have to drive to the public library to check out a book, I save money. When I can buy a seven year old iPad on ebay to cover my necessary hardware, I save money. When I can read any book every published through my public library's ebook subscriptions, Project Gutenberg, Archive.org, or Library Genesis, I save money. This is utopia for a reader, and one of the reasons I believe a digitized public library is such a valuable resource for a community. For example, I've taught myself index fund investing, personal finance, frugality, and FIRE strategies the past year completely though Library Genesis at a cost of zero dollars. I've turned my life around from having no money in the stock market to having a reasonable sum in tax-deferred index funds during that same year. Rather than being ignorant about FI and index funds and just thinking I needed to be frugal, I am now actively on the path to financial independence within ten years. All this knowledge for zero dollars. While I think listening to music inexpensively is a neat hack thanks to computers, I really feel that educating yourself for free is the 'killer app' for the twenty first century. Rather than shuffling between the public library every week, you can now read digitized books without ever going outside. You can put that money you save not driving back and forth to the public library towards buying a cup of joe at a cofeeshop and spending a day reading there for entertainment.

Public libraries were pretty darn cool even before they went digital -- it was my favorite place to go and hang out growing up (and the Topeka public library had a great art gallery which really affected my love of art, enough that I became an art history major). But with them going digital comes a great many benefits that even I couldn't have anticipated. I'm basically fluent in FIRE personal finance now thanks to the resources of Library Genesis and a bit of elbow grease in reading fifty or so books. When the resources your public library offered are mixed with other "digital public libraries" on the internet, you basically have all your bases covered. And if not, you can always subscribe to Safari Books to study computer science for $200 a year. Eventually you will able to read every book ever published for something around $20 a month. It's a remarkable time for self study, and the fact that you can read any book at the current moment through Library Genesis really changes the rules of the game. Rather than paying for the benefit of a university's library stack, you can read the exact same books that kids in college read FOR ZERO COST TO YOU other than internet and an ebook reader. There is really no reason to pay for college, considering the main benefit, a good library with advanced books, has been duplicated and made available online for free. There is nothing wrong with reading books on an iPad, it's quite pleasant and the screen being backlit is pretty neat too. Unfortunately you can't really read an iPad outdoors, but it's a small sacrifice. 

A public library has a greater impact than a university library. Rather than having a required fee for access, a public library is free to anyone. Whereas university library's don't really focus on digital books, a public library's main focus is increasing the number of digital books. PDFs and ePubs aren't a passing fad, they are as essential to modern life as mp3s. While people still like vinyl records, just like people still like paper books, there is no denying that the easiest way to consume the largest library of music/books are digitally. Library Genesis isn't going anywhere, it's now at the point that it will never be shut down other than when interest in using it wains due to the ease that an affordable Spotify-for-Books app can be used/subscribed. We've reached the utopia moment that almost all books, movies, and music ever created are available for a couple Hamiltons a month. Public libraries no longer need to buy expensive deadwood books, so they can devote their resources to things like ebooks and video subscription libraries like Lynda and Treehouse. Things are going to get better for patrons of digital public libraries, whereas things are only going to get more and more expensive for patrons of university libraries. The winner in the battle of education has been decided, and digital public libraries are much more beneficial to the world than university stacks. Not saying university stacks aren't fun, just maybe not worth the price of admission when compared to more affordable alternatives.

Best of luck in your journey of self improvement through digital books. I hope you read every book you ever want to for free and accomplish all your goals with zero debt. Aren't computers and computer networking amazing? Kind of makes you want to be a computer scientist and pass it on...

And that's my point. People pay a hundred thousand dollars to learn the rudiments of a discipline over four years at university for a bachelor's degree. Can you imagine the social benefit of digitizing that information so that you could receive an equivalent education for free? You would save people a hundred thousand dollars, and in a way that scales to reach thousands if not millions of people at nearly zero cost to the "free" university! That's why efforts like [EbookFoundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books), [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), Library Genesis, and all those MOOC platforms are so exciting. They have the potential to save millions of people tens of thousands of dollars. The only problem is you have to be self disciplined and self motivated, but I think the carrot of a hundred grand and a job is good bait. As public libraries themselves begin to offer platforms for their patrons which rival a computer science bachelor's degree (like Treehouse, Lynda, or Safari Books), there will even be greater incentive to jump ship from college and study for free at the public libraries online. A digital public library is radical in its scope. It can compete with colleges very easily. This idea, just like Open Source, is no longer going to be "fringe" but will be one of the common considerations an 18 year old has to take in regards to learning computer science. The idea that skipping college and studying CS at a digital public library will no longer seem ludicrous, but financially savvy.

With regards to concern over using Library Genesis, which in my opinion is just a public library like any other public library, I recommend: [https://questioncopyright.org/promise](https://questioncopyright.org/promise) Public libraries, in all forms, whether digital or deadwood, are the result of [Enlightenment radicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library#Enlightenment-era_libraries). The fact that modern public libraries in the 21st century now compete with colleges in their scope, reach, and affect should come as no surprise, again, this is just a fulfilling of Enlightenment tenets that liberal democratic education not be hidden away behind expensive tutor fees and only available to the aristocracy. Colleges decided that they want to cater to the aristocracy when they decided to charge usurious amounts of tuition paid for by non-bankruptable student loans, all so they could become fat cats like the aristocracy whose kids they chose to cater. Not that there's anything wrong with being an aristocrat, I guess, but some things like the invention of the internet have permitted "The People's University" to outcompete the real thing. Good! That was the university's choice when they moved away from societal good to being a parasite on 18-22 year olds when they realized [they could get away with it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt). It's like a mini public library Renaissance and the beast is back kicking stronger than ever.

This should be no surprise, because the requirements to publish and distribute a book online and in open source form are now found in any Raspberry Pi for $35 and a free github account. As publishing books no longer requires the infrastructure of printing presses and supply chains of distributors, now anyone can create open source books. The digitization of books is so inexpensive that it's a matter of quality of authorial product rather than quantity of publisher-owned printing presses. Obviously computer scientists stand to profit the most from open source, and that's why you see CS education in the position of being most cutting edge for inexpensive but efficient edtech. Just as publishers are being written out of the creation and distribution of books, so too colleges are being written out of the teaching of computer science. This is good because debt when you're young turns out to be really expensive when you have to pay of compounding loans rather than investing in compounding index funds. If an "education" in computer science costs more than a couple hundreds of dollars a year, it's probably a rip off. That's just empirical truth in 2019. Open source has won in the real-world-impact of education expenses, and tuition fees just can't compete with what is available for CS education through open source educational resources. If the textbook you are studying with for computer science isn't open source, you are probably being taken advantage of by someone. Knowing when to pay for CS educational resources is something that comes along with being Holm Schooled, you become a virtuoso of discerning when something is worth paying for. Usually the best judgements come to a value of a couple hundred a year, not anything like $10,000+ for public university. A single year of public university could fund fifty years of PluralSight. With those statistics, you'd better keep it safe and stick with the knowledge that comes from Holm Schooling and keeping debt as low as humanly possible while young. You can probably get a job after studying fifty years of PluralSight, but you probably would find it much more difficult to find a job with just a year of CS at a public university. The goal is to get a job as fast as possible with costs as low as possible. The strategies you learn at Holm School will enable you to secure a programming job -- which then you can get all the degrees and certificates you need with tuition reimbursement -- with close to zero debt. Personally I would chose fifty years of PluralSight over a year of CS at a public university any day. Those are the types of cost analysis you need to consider when you're 18 and staring at the college admissions abyss. Take the frugal choice: Your public library, OpenEd, and affordable EdTech.

I truly believe that it is a monumental time to be alive with regards to affordable education. Library Genesis is essentially a college education for free. An international digital public library is a futuristic idea, but that's what Library Genesis is. It's a revolutionary tool for anyone interested in learning science. Rather than being beholden to tie yourself up with student loans for a crack at some books at a university library, you are essentially liberated from debt and able to "study" on your own using every STEM book ever written for the cost of internet each month. Considering reading books is the best way to study, it truly knocks the socks off any MOOC or video tutorial library. I would suggest combining video tutorials with a heavy reliance on Library Genesis, and power through as much computer science studying as you can while you're unemployed. It's a free college education in a bottle. It won't necessarily be around forever, some real legal tangles are being tossed its way, so use it in its present form as much as you can. Having an international public library of STEM is the type of thing that could cause a Renaissance, and anyone who is interested in learning STEM (honestly, there aren't that many people who are) can up their game for zero cost. Considering STEM has many public benefits, humanity really stands to prosper because of Library Genesis. There is no need to wait for public libraries to expand their digital offerings and video tutorial subscriptions, at this moment you can self educate a college education at Library Genesis. It is silly to go into debt for STEM if it isn't required. Many people want more scientists in the world because of their return on investment as they invent new things, so people will always strive to make STEM Education resources available for as cheaply as possible. You stand to benefit directly if you have the brain for STEM. Turning your back on modern technology like cloud databases and international networking is like anathema to what science hopes to achieve. To think that the public library has nothing to offer you as a scientist is antiquated. Many schools want to promote the notion that you can only become a scientist at university. This might be true in other STEM disciplines, but certainly not computer science. Everything necessary to become a computer scientist is available at Library Genesis. Don't be made to feel guilty for using a public library to become a scientist. Get a college education for free through Library Genesis.

I am honestly so excited for digital public libraries because I truly belief we are basically going to instigate a Renaissance with the ubiquity of free ebooks. Computers/the internet are instigating a Renaissance right now that most of us are oblivious to, but I think with kids now able to teach themselves a college CS curriculum for free, we're just going to keep causing Renaissance after Renaissance. It's almost like Renaissances are Compounding thanks to the invention of computer. It's a fiercesome force when free markets, global peace, international liberal democracies, and science/computers are all reaching an apex three hundred years after the Enlightenment. Maybe even AI will mature a bit and cause a Renaissance of its own? I'm not impressing anyone with edicts that the internet is revolutionary, but want I want to instill is that using it to teach yourself for free isn't a crime, it's actually the direct product of hundreds of years of post-Enlightenment research and development. Library Genesis, just like Napster, will eventually be replaced by a (legal) subscription service. But as we learned with Napster, the digital software comes before the legal precedence. It's perfectly natural to anyone who grew up with computers, but older people might not understand that copying digital files isn't theft. They hear it and think we're sticking up authors for their lunch money on the sidewalk. 

Unfortunately those same older people allowed "the system" to regress to the point that college education, rather than being universally available in liberal democracies, is affordable by only the rich. Other people are screwing themselves financially trying to get a university education. While that marks itself as a failure to some degree, personally I don't care because the public library and other digital libraries, legal and illegal, are picking up the slack. Many capitalists are not motivated by the Enlightenment, which ironically invented capitalism, and are willing to sacrifice Enlightenment ideals to protect their and their children's privilege. That's what John Bogle calls "manager's capitalism" and there is truly a battle for the soul of capitalism at the moment. Fortunately we have a good weapon on our side for this glorious revolution against manager's capitalism: the internet. You can't compete with science (and computer networking). People talked shit on wikipedia but look what we have now: a free encyclopedia. Library Genesis will also go from being scorned to being considered disruptive technology once a proprietary version comes out that clones its utility. Inexpensive legal book archives are just around the corner, and accordingly, inexpensive college educations will soon be legal and mainstream. It is inevitable. Open source software is going to be the dominant paradigm for software, and probably can be considered the main engineering practice now. There will be more and more educational services offered by public libraries for free for all patrons around America, and Treehouse/Lynda/SafariBooks is just the beginning of the offerings. It's going to get amazingly ridiculous, and I am just going to sit back and laugh and laugh as colleges are forced to adapt, thinking about the $70,000 I spent on a zero-ROI art history degree. Their obvious response will be to raise tuition in order to maintain the Prestige with a capital P that is essential to their marketability, but Prestige won't buy you back $70,000 of debt at age 22. That $2.6+ million dollars of evaporated retirement money for four years of just reading some books and writing some essays will speak for itself to the next generation of computer scientists, and they'll find communities that meta-educate on what to do to succeed education-wise outside the boundaries of the university. Open source meta-educational communities like this one, OSSU, and EbookFoundation, and many others on github, I hope. Otherwise we're going to keep facing the student debt crisis in the face of Free-College-Educations available through your local public library and Library Genesis. I would rather that $2.6 million go to students rather than Prestige U. Four years of reading some [public domain humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_books) or computer science books can be done at your public library or even on Project Gutenberg. $2.6 million or a piece of paper/degree, the choice is yours. [Don't be a consumer sucka](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/18/news-flash-your-debt-is-an-emergency/). Just plop that cost of college, public or private, into a compound calculator and set interest to 10% and years to 35-38 to simulate a few years of a maxed out 401ks and IRAs to mimick the saved tuition. It'll blow your mind (ever seen the back of a $2 million dollar bill on weeeeeeed, man?) That's what Library Genesis is: It's a free $2 million dollar bill on the pavement. Don't let your guilt/morals dictate that you keep walking on in hopes that it's retrieved by its rightful owner eventually: Pick the damn $2 million dollar bill up and stuff it in your wallet! Finders keepers.

Lots of people don't understand the meaning behind free artifacts on the internet. They think it's voodoo magic or some sort of wizardry. Perhaps it is a sort of wizardry, but it's a beneficial wizardry and not detrimental. Many people decide to go on the track that have historically been travelled, going to college and signing up for tens of thousands of dollars of loans, and paying them off your first decade or so as a programmer. That's ridiculous in my opinion in this day and age of a digital public library, and there is radical potential to avoiding debt at an early age and learning CS on your own. Don't fall into the trap of thinking the alternative path is wizardry, it's quite classical -- if not [neoclassical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism) -- in its intent to disseminate liberal arts and science knowledge as widely as possible. Just because it's digital doesn't mean it's anything new. The internet, after all, is basically just an [international public library](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Global-Libraries). To think of it otherwise, as is the case of social media, is disastrous. If you are doing something on the internet that isn't treating it like a digital public library, you are probably wasting your precious time and fuelling addictive behavior.

## #21 - College is Just Gamified Reading

College is the "video game" of education. By this I mean, whereas you can entertain yourself for free using the public library, both online and offline, many people spend their time playing videos games (which are not available for free at the public library). I could simplify this by propsing the "Public Library Sniff Test," in which the basic tenet is that if something isn’t available for free at the public library, it isn’t worth pursuing. This principle has guided me well in my life. I haven’t played video games for about 15 years, and as a result have said probably thousands of dollars wasting my time and requiring new computers every few years. Instead I used (up until last month) a ten year old computer and a seven year old iPad. In the words of Mr. Money Mustache: “Fairly boring, which is exactly how investing is supposed to be.”

In thinking about this principle recently, I discovered it also applies to college. Public libraries don’t offer college courses taught by professors (presumably they could) for free. Is college just another video game?

Making sure this wasn’t a misreading of something related more to funding/expense rather than education-related, I looked at my own public library. If the goal is a college level education in computer science, my public library offers something very close to it with a subscription to Treehouse and Lynda for their patrons. Throw in a few open coursewares along the way coupled with some OER textbooks, and it was basically a free college education through the public library. So a conclusion: Yes, college educations are not a waste of time, so yes they are offered by the public library. The difference is that the college education offered by the public library is completely stripped of gamification, which positions the non-public library college education as something much more akin to a video game than a valuable book.

Let’s explore gamification in college. First are the grades and degrees. Rather than just learning things as affordably as possible, you are positioned as a player in a game that requires you play the four levels (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) in such a way that you maximize the points earned in a certain time period. These points are “requisites” and “prerequisites” for the final goal of earning a degree, in which you beat the game. Does my public library impose time limits (other than the due date of loaned-out books?). No, it is self paced. Does my library require that I attempt to maximize points in order to win the game? No, there is no degree at the end and as a result there is no point system. Am I inundated with trying to accelerate my education as fast as possible so that I don’t find myself in unsurpassable debt? Nope, again it’s free and self-paced to the limit of ability rather than proposing guidelines for time limits, and there isn’t a “penalty” for failing to complete the levels within the time limit. I came to the conclusion that college is just gamified reading, and that you’re paying the premium for that gamification instead of just entertaining (in this case, educating) yourself for free at the public library.

Video games a great way to completely blow your money. There are some rewards, like increased eye hand coordination, but their main benefit: hopefully a complex storyline, can also be found for free at what’s available at the public library. They have huge upfront costs: the latest hardware, the latest laptop, the latest console, the fastest internet. Colleges also have these, they are just found in tuition costs and dorm room expense. They appeal to young people, sometimes having unwritten age limits that people who don’t fit into the narrow 18-22 year old band sometimes have difficulty overcoming. Planned obsolescence is basically built into the package. Deviating from social norms of playing is considered boring or pretentious, and the publishers earn a lot for your continued dedication (i.e. TF2 hats’ equivalent of the college union/bookstore and their licensed fangear), so they want to maximize perceived entertainment value over true educational value. Public libraries don’t have hats and tshirts and fan communities (well, except maybe here).

College conferences are kind of like a video game. Instead of learning anything proportional to the cost, it’s basically a power play to see who can dominate the scoreboard and get the most “points” by talking intelligently about the reading material as much as possible. It’s zero sum and either you win or lose at semester’s end and the timelimit is up. Just like you can watch a let’s play on YouTube and learn the basic storyline of a video game rather than paying for it, you can just watch a “let’s play” of OpenCourseWare or a free college lecture series and learn the story without actually fidgeting with the controller. Turns out the real value is the storyline, not the eye hand coordination gains (i.e. public speaking skills used in conference). Of course there is value in eye hand coordination and speaking skills, but is that value worth tens of thousands of dollars when you can use alternative methods, such as talking with friends or joining a reading club?

It is somewhat irresponsible to blow your money on college, just like it’s irresponsible to blow your money on playing video games. OER/OCW really beats the “video game” that passes for college socialization, which is basically drinking and doing drugs. College isn’t straight edge, it’s a video game that requires unhealthy behavior. You should go out and exercise in the neighborhood with friends rather than drinking in a dorm room. Just like video games are psychologically addictive, college requires consuming expensive, addictive substances weekly if not daily. Without sounding like a PSA, you should get addicted to straightedge and reading science books, rather than a crappy social scene. Scientists don’t drink, at least any one you’ve read about in history books.

Remove all restrictions that inhibit your time for reading, like commuting costs and having to work to pay for tuition/dorm/cafeteria food/textbooks. Just by cooking for yourself, living at home, and going to the public library each day or reading Library Genesis on your ipad, you’re able to get a college level education in computer science. After you get employed you can focus on getting degrees through their tuition reimbursement benefit plan.

If you are concerned about not having a degree for your first computer science job search, make a github resume that contains each and every CS book you’ve read and OCW you’ve completed during your length of study. That’ll speak for itself and get you jobs. No one can argue with results and hard work.

College has levels and bosses that make you feel like you accomplished something, i.e. a grind, but that’s just gamification. Does a public library have levels and bosses? No, because it’s an archive and not an expensive video game. Does a public university offer a college education? No, because it’s too expensive for the limited rewards. If video games just cost a couple dollars, I bet public libraries would start stocking up on them. But the ROI is too low to justify their archiving. You can bet video game publishers are brainstorming ways to prevent computer games from becoming so affordable that public libraries can stock them on their shelves, because that would cut into their profits. So too are colleges, with things like degrees and socratic seminars as a way to hedge against people turning to their public library instead of paying those bloated tuition and textbook fees. I mean, textbooks are so expensive that public libraries can even afford to stock them on their shelves. That should speak volumes about where the priorities of colleges are, and they aren’t in saving you money and maximizing your education ROI.

Just like you don’t need to spend thousands on a gaming laptop when you can watch the game free on YouTube, you can use various online and offline public libraries to watch “the game” of college. Gamification is obviously fun, but find a way to incorporate it into your Library Genesis use rather than paying out the wazoo at a university. Make a catalog of every book you read on Github pages and update it everytime you finish a textbook. Blog about Holm Schooling. Open up a Vanguard IRA or brokerage account so you can watch your savings compound. Gamify frugality by going to goodwill to shop and trying to find bargains. Go vegan and live on cheap dried goods and affordable produce and fruit (can you beat my record of $100 a month?). Can you maintain a used car for 200,000 miles, or incorporate biking as a replacement? Can you find cheap goods on craigslist? Can you use the time saved on not commuting towards exercise and fitness? There are plenty of fun “levels” and bosses to conquer if you unschool rather than pay for college. See a way to break free from the normativity of gamified reading for outrageous prices and just sticking with plain old, run-of-the-mill reading for free. Read as much as you can, then relax by refining your life towards the goal of financial independence rather than prestige.

Make your video game Github. Level up on Github rather than accumulating expensive college credits, which aren’t open source. Contribute to Holm School if that’s the curriculum you’re using, and help out your “teachers” on Github through the repos you use rather than just handing over your money to professors for what passes as homework. Read and study, don’t play video games. That’s a rule for life, no matter what form the video games take. You can save money just by focusing on the reading part and divesting from the game. Is college, with all the degrees and accolades and prestige, not just a video game? I think it is. Library Genesis, OER/OCW, and your public library are free reading, and accordingly free college. It’s not gamified reading, but it is free reading, and that’s what’s important, not prestige and “achievements.” Make sure your achievements are IRL and related to education and not just icons on a video game profile page.

I sort of realized this when I played Asheron's Call at 13 years of age. They had just implemented housing in the game, and you could collect in game items to decorate your abode (which was really expensive in in-game money and effort). I realized one day that, rather than focusing on having a cool video game house, I should focus on improving myself so that one day I could afford a real life house and decorations. Video games would actually hurt my abilities to be successful enough in life to afford an expensive house, because they distracted me from "deep work," as Cal Newport would put it. So I quit buying new video games. I quit spending money on them and studied instead.

Now I'm older and realize the same thing of college. Rather than spending money on graduate school and going into debt, I should just focus on studying and improving my computer science skills rather than paying for a gamified education which just results in having a "higher level" in a resume and nothing than can be accomplished in real life without the massive debt. I want a real house that I can decorate, not just a higher level in a video game and more virtual coins and houses.

Stick with public libraries, online and offline, for you're education and you'll be directly benefitting your life without the side effects of expensive tuition and books. Resist the call to gamification that colleges have perfected, and quit playing video games completely. Addiction, whether to video games, alcohol and drugs, or prestigious degrees, threatens you directly. Computer science can be learned for free and has real rewards, and as such you should focus on doing that rather than just entertaining yourself. Hard work doesn't require a lot of expense. Results speak for themselves, and unschooling computer science is a great way to live a life of a scientist. This is possible thanks to open source. Let me know when video games/bricks and mortar colleges are free and open source. I'm willing to bet not in your lifetime.

## #20 - You Should Insist On Nonpaper Books

Today I learned about Perlego books just by googling "Spotify for Books." I'm pretty sure I search this every 3 months looking for the latest news, but for some reason had never discovered them. After just a brief excursion into their webpage, I am feeling confident about them. They basically are brand new, having just 600 followers on Twitter, but their pricing model is awesome: 12 pounds a month. This is about $185 a year. This is more expensive than Spotify, but for an initial offering without any market competitors at the moment, this price point is awesome! Unfortunately it’s only available in the EU, but when it comes to America I will most definitely be subscribing. I have longed to stop using Library Genesis, but without any subscription service for books that is complete, I am left with the option of paying Amazon usurious prices for kindle books. I refuse to do that, because single-purchase ebooks is a horrible model when there is Library Genesis and plenty of free CS OER, not to mention free subscriptions to Lynda and Treehouse at my public library. Some public libraries are even subscribing to SafariBooks, and maybe one day will subscribe to Perlego!

I hope once this plan comes out in America, that computer science professors will move to having a curriculum that uses books available on it. Obviously I am not optimistic, because professors seem to be deluded into believing that textbooks should be as expensive as possible when they basically cost as much as a year’s subscription to PluralSight. A paper book should never cost that much, nor should an ebook. With Library Genesis I haven’t bought a book for three years, and I don’t intend to start. I do, however, intend to subscribe to Perlego and will focus my study efforts on books offered on their platform. I am very comfortable doing this, because I believe in subscription services that offer 100% coverage of their target media, and so I subscribe to Apple Music. I don’t subscribe to anything movie-related because nothing offers 100% coverage yet. And what I do want to watch on my iPad, i.e. Teaching Company video lectures, are well covered in my free Kanopy subscription thanks to my alma mater’s (Washburn’s) university library. Kanopy is also offered through the Lawrence, KS public library. So my bases are covered, fortunately. The only other media not covered by a subscription is books, and here it looks like we finally have some potential that can initiate further market competitors from Apple and Google, which will offer 100% coverage while also being competitive in pricing. If you’ve followed Google Books since it’s invention, you’ll know that the Author’s Guild has used lawsuit after lawsuit to prevent books from being digitized and offered online. Hopefully now tides are changing with the success of Spotify/Apple Music.

I basically think there should be a Federal public library. It seems foolhardy to build public libraries in each town and be responsible for stocking their shelves with paper books when you could just offer a single Federal online public library and let all Americans read ebooks for free. I think this Federal public library could also find it’s calling in listing available OER for free download, and could even use government funds to sponsor the writing of OER (which would then be free online for anybody forever). Right now nonprofit endeavors like OpenStax are doing this, but I don’t see why it couldn’t be done at the Federal level. Having a Federal public library could put books into the hands of everyone in America, all without the tax burden of individual-town public libraries. Or else town public libraries could be a branch of the Federal library, offering amenities like Treehouse/Lynda subscriptions on top of a 100% coverage Federal public library. I think this would be a great modern Moonshot project, especially since books are infinitely more useful than Spotify or Netflix. To ignore digital books, by both state governments and federal governments, would be negligent. I love that my local public library subscribes to Libby/Overdrive, as I find going digital a necessity, but I don’t find their coverage useful enough for my research needs to use it instead of Library Genesis, not to mention that I need to wait up to two weeks for a copy of the book to be free. For the moment, Library Genesis is acting as a Federal public library, and I’m loving its utility until something legal and affordable can be invented. I also find a lot of potential in archive.org’s ebook borrowing model, which is offered through public libraries around the state, but again the offering is usually for 10+ year old books rather than recently published books. And again, book checkout counts are artificially restricted.

Perhaps we’ll live in a future where local public libraries will offer a subscription to a 100% coverage book service. For now, I think it’s important to emphasize the importance on insisting on nonpaper books. There is basically no future for paper books, especially with reading ebooks on an ipad/tablet such a pleasant experience. Today I threw away my collection of vinyl records, because I haven’t listened to a vinyl record in four years and it’s taking up space in my room. I kept a few that “spark joy,” in the words of Marie Kondo, but otherwise I’m happy. Of course, the past decade I’ve gotten rid of 99% of my print books too. I use to have an entire wall of books in four large bookcases, funded through my public library’s booktique that sold books for 25 cents while I was in high school. I have never been happier, especially with the invention of Library Genesis. There is a lot of advantages of not having any paper books, and I’m finding that Library Genesis and an ipad is an even better reading experience than paper. Why would I waste space in my room on paper books? Just like I don’t have a CD or vinyl collection anymore, I feel no need to have paper books in the age of Library Genesis. When someone invents the Spotify for books, this will be (legally) even more true.

I think about how colleges are built around paper books. Their libraries offer very few ebooks, and you usually have to install an intrusive piece of software like Adobe Digital Editions that have like a one-week checkout time period. Reading books on a laptop is basically hell on earth, and I don’t see why universities require you to go through so many hoops (having an adobe account along with your university account) in order to read their digital books. They don’t even curate their digital collections anywhere in libraries. Libby is a great app, for example, with great curation (although science isn’t their focus, as they usually only have pop science books). 

I believe if you are using paper books, you are basically writing yourself out of the benefits of free and affordable education. Computer science books are around $40 each, which is frankly ridiculous. This is tremendously expensive to you as well as other reading providers like public and university libraries. This cost is unsustainable, and pretty darn retrograde in the day and age of iPads and the internet. The internet provides a pipeline for reading ebooks that, as Library Genesis shows, can be basically free. Legal alternatives will be affordable, I’m sure, once they pass the hurdles put in place by publishers and authors’ guilds. Colleges are using an old model of reading that emphasizes paper books. Their bookstores only offer paper books and if they do offer digital books, they are nearly the same price as their deadwood equivalent. Colleges will try and say things like paper books facilitate discussion because of the standardized page numbers in bookstore editions, but I think that rather just goes to show that socratic seminars are kind of an outdated concept in the age of free OpenCourseWare and ebook readers. It’s basically the writing on the wall that colleges, with their enormous pricetags and costs to participate, don’t have much of a future with the modern internet.

If you use your iPad to read books, there is no reason not to go ahead and skip college and read the necessary books to know how to program at your first job for a fraction of a percent as brick and mortar college. Those paper books have no future, and just like I swept out all my paper books, vinyl records, and even DVDs, there’s no need to not sweep out the “deadwood” version of college. It’s an unsustainable expense for everyone involved, and clutters up (and weighs down) your life rather than augmenting it. Storing your entire book collection on your iPad is just an immensely gratifying experience if you are a voracious reader. Storing your entire college experience on the internet, if you are a voracious lifelong student, is one too.

There are some radical changes in store once Perlego comes to America. It will obviously engender the opening up of the Apple, Amazon, and Google archives too. The ability to read every book every published for $15 a month will forever change humanity for those that can afford $15, and heck maybe even local and Federal governments will start paying that fee on their citizen’s behalf. With ubiquitous affordable ebooks, which Library Genesis gives a beta version of, just like Napster provided a beta version of affordable music, the world truly stands to prosper. Teaching computer science will no longer be the stronghold of university, but will spread itself out to many open source educational nonprofits that step in where traditional nonprofit universities fail (mainly on the pricepoint and financial burden to young kids). No one should be tens of thousands in dollars of debt at age 22 when they begin their first job. The financial burden, when the 40 years of compound interest are sacrificed at student loan’s altar, equates to student loans costing 32-64 times the MSRP. When you declutter the university library and use only ebooks, you’ll find that the need of paying expensive tuition evaporates. It just isn’t the future. And ignoring what the future abodes is a great way to shoot yourself in the future. As computer scientists we share the burden of knowing about future technology, its impact, and ways to change our daily practices in order to benefit rather than be harmed by changes in society. Just like avoiding open source is a great way to sabotage your goals as a computer scientists, refusing to use digital media/archives/subscriptions is a great way to sabotage your chances of financial independence at a young age.

The university library is quaint, especially when you consider it’s tied to non-bankruptable student loan debt. It’s a symbol of exploitation rather than Enlightenment, as public libraries are. Enlightenment principles will explode once an affordable Spotify for Books is invented. Let’s hope this takes the form of Perlego at first, then the big tech companies can make their versions, then the local public libraries can create their offering, and finally a Federal public library will develop for future Americans. It’s a long journey ahead but be sure I’ll be watching it intensely. Maybe even people who offer college scholarships will change their philanthropy to focus on providing 100% ebook subscription packages to potential students who can’t afford it in its early, non-free phase. I bring up the Enlightenment because, if you’ve read Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now, you know liberal democracy is making the world extremely awesome. I think a good example of this is the emphasis on switching over to ebooks at a learning platform. It’s affordability holds radical potential for Enlightenment goals. Let’s embrace this potential now, rather than sleeping on it and further impacting our youth to their detriment.

## #19 - Literacy is More Important than Conferences

College conferences are pretty cool. It's a good way to get to know people and focus your friendship around academic pursuits. But the problem is that conference time costs tens of thousands of dollars a year, whereas reading ebook on your computer is a potentially free activity. Unfortunately for the student who is on the hook with nonbankruptable college loans, literacy is more important than conference experience.

That's one of the central premises behind why I'm throwing up a free OER curriculum that overloads the student with book readings at the sacrifice of (obviously) paying for a professor to lead a conference-style class. Conference is important, almost an essential part of the college experience, proponents of colleges will say. Online learning results in a stunted student with no speaking skills or critical thinking capacity. But is this true? Fortunately, I don't believe that to be the case. And that's why Holm School created a computer science curriculum that is dominant with reading OER (with a few OpenCourseWare classes). I believe computer science literacy trumps conference literacy. I think the real benefit of college is the time you spend in the library reading books off the wonderful stacks at college libraries. Time spent reading is much more valuable than conference time. That's why colleges are successful employment preparation, they train their students to spend as much time as possible reading books. Reading books is like compounding interest -- it's your friend and ally. But is conference time an ally? Probably not, and you can see that in the fact that there are no open source computer science conference technologies.

While there are many OER books concerning computer science -- and anything not open source is available on Library Genesis -- there seems to be no open source computer science class conferences. People might blame this on insufficient technology, but I highly doubt that. The technology is there, but it has been jettisoned by the OER community in exchange for focusing on open source books and textbooks. This aligns with my experience that time clocked reading books is more important than time clocked in conference. Conference time is non-digitizable, it's not able to be recreated for free on the internet. This is not a benefit, as college marketers and admissions office try to paint it as. It means that there is an outmoding of conference in the realm of open source versus the explosion of open source books. There are vast libraries of computer science texts available free through [EbookFoundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books), but there are no vast libraries of computer science socratic seminars. You might scoff and say that's dumb, but not in my opinion. That's because, in my experience, conference in reality just serves as an opportunity for students to demonstrate to the professor that they did the reading and are deserving of a good grade. There is not much critical thought involved. The conference exists only for the benefit of the professor who is tasked with determining grades, so they continually ping the conference to see who is doing their reading or not. When you unschool computer science, you aren't dependent on grades because all your professors are digital archives, so you don't need a conference at all. Conference isn't digitizable because grades aren't digitizable. You need a person, an interlocutor, to assign grades. Avoid that phenomenon and you avoid the overhead of traditional college, versus the radical potential of teaching yourself computer science free online using OER and your public library.

So part of the prerequisite of success unschooling is having access to a ton of books, which through sheer number can make up for any deficiency of not having conference time. Reading is much more valuable than conference, so if you spend all your time reading books on computer science, you're going to be a competent computer scientist. The real value of conference for a student is that through professorial intervention of determining grades based on conference participation, students are forced to do some heavy reading. If you are self motivated and can induce yourself to read every second of free time you have, you are going to be successful as a computer science student. The problem that existed before was that there were no extensive digital libraries, so not having access to a college library greatly inhibited the number of books you could read in your free time. That is no longer the case, with extensive OER libraries as well as services like Archive.org and Library Genesis. Now nearly every book is available for reading. The opportunities aren't limited based on availability, but now merely time. You can read every book on college computer science syllabi thanks to Library Genesis on your ipad at home. You can read any book you think would be an ancillary benefit to your education too, without having to be reliant on a college library stack. That's a remarkable change to education, and now it makes more sense to read as many important books as possible at home for free instead of going tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with that opportunity of access to a vast library only offered at brick and mortar universities. Once a digital archive of a college library is available for free online for anyone, as Library Genesis does, the need to go to college is removed.

So I believe OER is a precious present gifted to people willing to read as much as humanly possible in four years. Books are much better at conveying information and learning than conferences ever are, and so having access to a vast library of computer science texts for free is basically making college free. Since most students haven't had four years of their time free for self-directed learning during their youth, they don't recognize the utility of open ed and Library Genesis. Whereas people might argue that Library Genesis is destroying author profits, I don't believe that to be the case. No one who goes to college ever buys the books that they read from their library stacks anyway. They check it out for free at the circ desk. The colleges are the ones making money off the criticalness of books, they are a sort of lamprey that earns their food at the cost of book authors, who don't get paid any more than a dollar when a college library purchases their book. That maybe translates to a few hundred dollars at the various college libraries around the nation. When Library Genesis serves as a college library with a student body of everybody, they don't affect the author's bottomline but instead remove the need to pay for college to access books. This is a big boon to humanity, because instead of doing into debt when they're young, student can take the money they save self educating for free and put that into index funds, which translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time they retire.

Instead of charging big bucks for tuition from their students, Library Genesis just charges the inconvenience of having to look at an ad. That's because their costs, which are very low thanks to open source server technology and affordable internet, are covered enough just by a couple ads. If you ask me if I view a free college education that is covered by ad revenue illegal, I would call you crazy and insist that this college be seen as a real phenomenon thanks to the internet that is deserving of praise and admiration. It is a mix of entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and forward thinking regarding modern education practices. This entrepreneurial mindset has taken college costs and simplified them by trimming the fat (the football stadiums, the land cost, utilities, the rock walls and lazy pools) and simply offering the most critical aspect of education for free: books. This is not a crime to be a student of Library Genesis. It is a model of college that, admittedly, is non traditional, but paying your tuition through just a few ads per week is possible thanks to technology. I never paid for using the books available at my college library either. My tuition went to maintaining the utilities required by maintaining a physical library, but digitize the collection and servers offering the same service costs mere pennies per student. This is not illegal, this is not criminal, this is what being a student in 2019 is. To think that avoiding tuition worth tens of thousands of dollars is deserving of criticism isn't applying critical thinking skills.

So college books are digitized while college conferences aren't. That's not surprising to anyone who has experienced the marginal utility of conference time. The conference only benefits the professor due to making their assignment of grades for each student easier. Cut the grades, the non-digital-archived professor, and the bricks and mortar and electrical costs, and the conference and a college education is paid for through ad revenue. That's the reality of Library Genesis and OER, and that's why going into debt to earn a computer science degree is equivalent to punching yourself in the face. If you are a reader, which most successful scientists are, then you'll be fine teaching yourself computer science through books and getting a job instead of relying on a degree to do the heavy lifting for you. Go through the work of reading a college-equivalent curriculum using free ebooks for four years, if not using the extra free time and money you have not paying for college to read above and beyond the number of books usually read by a computer science student, and you'll definitely find yourself skilled enough to find a job. Then you can pay for a college degree using tuition reimbursement through your employer's benefits instead of footing the cost yourself. You wind up at the same place with a maxed-out IRA and 401k, invested in index funds, for many years at age 22, instead of non-bankruptable student debt and zero savings at the time when your savings net you [32-times-the-amount-saved growth effortlessly](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-09-Ending-Thoughts.html#the-secrets-of-compounding-interest-from-a-programmers-perspective/).

Books are more efficacious education transmitters than conference ever will be. That's why open source education proponents have focused on OER instead of open source class conferences. If that weren't the case, then you can be guaranteed we'd have open source class conferences. The need for inexpensive education is vast, because saddling people who are self motivated enough to go to college with immense debt is basically ruining America. Now that books, both OER and non, are available for free on the internet through digital public libraries, paid for through inconspicuous ads or donations, the need to pay for college is absolutely gone. The quasi-utopia that comes from inexpensive books is a promise made hundreds if not thousands of years ago fulfilled. Though publishers will always view public libraries as a threat, fortunately publishers are not the government and fulfilling the need to educate the populace affordably will always trump publisher's self-need. That's the promise made by the creation of writing, which wasn't done for self-interested capitalistic reasons but a way to facilitate communication between distant people (which fulfills capitalistic needs of distant people, fortunately). Considering free trade creates peace, and free books facilitates the globalization of potential students, facilities like Archive and Library Genesis are creating peace through digitizing books and making them available for free. That's because technology is always invented to facilitate writing and books and communication.

Literacy is the tool that will purchase your success as a worker in the modern, technological world. If you ignore books and don't read, you are not going to contribute to society. People say that people who don't go to college don't contribute to society, but I find that to be an attempt to fix a syndrome instead of the disease. People who don't read nor promote literacy don't contribute to society. Considering ebooks are now free, you can cut out college and instead read any book you want for free, and accordingly you can contribute to society as a reader and literate computer scientist instead of paying tens of thousands of dollars for access to books. Books use to be a scarce resource, but thanks to technology are now basically free. The cost of serving books can be covered through simple digital ads or donations now, not anything like the previous cost of books before the internet, computers, and open source technology. In other words, you can contribute to society at zero cost to you. You stand to earn money for benefitting society through computer science, so instead of paying for the college stacks you're debt free and able to save in index funds thanks to your frugality and build yourself effortlessly (just the cost of being frugal) a comfortable retirement. There should be zero guilt associated with unschooling. Seeing the waste and marginal utility of college versus investing in index funds while debt-free is applied critical thinking. The spectre of debt needs to be eliminated in modern times. Thanks to capitalistic innovation which brings us modern technology, we stand to have a very successful life. Everything that affords you a comfortable life has been built thanks to innovations in the cost of serving up books to the populace. That is the hinge upon which liberal democracies are built. The Greeks invented democracy around the time they stopped being an oral society. That's no coincidence, it is simply a fundamental theorem that books are the hexis upon which the body of modern free-trade libera democracies are built. There is no capitalism without affordable books, there is no technology without affordable books, and there is no democracy and peace without affordable books. Instead of being self conscious about using the latest manifestation of public libraries, now serving their patrons on the internet instead of downtown, we need to change our lives thanks to the changing world afforded by free books. Considering they are the best vehicle for the transmission of education, we need to facilitate their success instead of attempting to sue them out of oblivion through copyright law.

Things change, and industries (yes, even nonprofit ones) are retired thanks to advanced in technology. College was never guaranteed a continued existence. It had a good run, but as of late student loans have exploded instead of shrunk as technology improved. That just shows that colleges aren't able to cope with advanced in digitization and server technology. Instead they are finding themselves replaceable as open source education advances at a more rapid rate than them. Change need not be mourned. What was important to the previous generation need not be the sacred cow to the next generation. Considering youth today are being devastated by student loans, the digitization of public libraries should be celebrated as an answer to a crisis. There will always be naysayers, but they are not the people who will be read two thousands years from now, as the Greeks who invented democracy are today. That's because capitalism and democracy benefits from people not being in debt (even if that debt is generated pursuing a noble cause such as education). People will not keep pursuing going to college if that pursuit results in them getting punched in the face too many times. Considering the public libraries are serving their stacks digitally now for free, colleges will never be competitive to hardcore readers (who know that books are more important than conferences). Why pay for conference time when you can just read a book that your mom or dad's also read and discuss it with them? As literacy improves thanks to technology, the non-literate will become the literate and the need to attend conference with fellow literary students will decrease. As more moms and dads learn computer science, they'll be able to guide their children's education using free ebooks instead of paying for a professor to do so.

I think the most valuable gift to a child is literacy. Promoting reading is like applying compound interest or Moore's Law to a child. People who attempt to restrict reading to line their own pockets are abhorrent to me. In an age of abundance where all one's critical needs are affordable thanks to being digitized, the regressive attempts to preserve copyright at all costs due to viral hits will be cast to the dogs. The more realistic need of education a world at scale and affordably will trump the Dan Brown authors and Kanye musicians. That's because literacy isn't mere entertainment, but the vehicle upon which modern liberal democracy, capitalism, and free trade rely. It's not self interested to promote literacy, it is the foundation through which liberating technology is based. Literacy trumps the needs of college administrators and professors every time.

If you can find a way to promote literacy, do so in any capacity. I built Holm School based on the belief that reading vast amounts of computer science OER can produce in a student a college-equivalent education for free. When combined with the services of a public library, the risks associated with student debt are vanquished. I'm not surprised that the solution to a crisis is to promote and facilitate affordable books. That's pretty much been the standard for civilization since writing was invented. You can choose to promote civilization, or attempt to impede its progress for personal gain. Personally I stand on the side of public libraries, both digital and physical, because I believe their aims are to promote civilization instead of protecting their own stakes at any cost to the public.

It will take time for people to realize that college can now be payed for through the "expense" of viewing a few ads. It will take time for people to realize that literacy is available at the cost of a Raspberry Pi or a cheap tablet. It will take time for people to realize that the college experience isn't the classroom but instead the library, where you read books in your free time. Open source books can now be paid for through a global kickstarter of donations instead of done by a publisher that tries to extract every last penny from its creation, for as long as possible through copyright law. Kids will learn to read through their public library, which now exist on their tablet. Computer scientists will teach themselves to program through OER and Library Genesis instead of expensive colleges. That's just the progression of society. Being an early adopter, usually done through the right mixture of interest in reading with interest in technological innovation, can combine into explosive results that produce unimaginable wealth for the tech-and-personal-finance literati. Reading is a skill that now, just like at any other time during civilization, has the potential to improve people's lives. The focus needs to be on literacy instead of college. If the federal government used their resources to create a digital national public library, every book ever written would be accessible for just a few tax dollars per person. If the federal government sponsored the creation of OER textbooks which covered the topics of a computer science degree, they could train everyone in America to become a programmer at no cost to the person other than a few tax dollars. I think this will probably be the future of learning, especially since Library Genesis shows that international public libraries can be paid for through a couple ad clicks ("taxes") per person. College is not the future, widespread digital and online literacy is. If you ignore this trend, you'll find yourself in debt that compounds to the equivalent of millions of dollars instead of flourishing as a frugal computer scientist who invests in index funds starting at a young age. The choice is yours, as you bear the risks of being on the cutting edge. But along with riskier speculation comes the potential for greater profit. So I'm sharing my experience with benefitting from my public library to promote unschooling to others. I think this prediction will bear fruit for anyone who agrees with its premises. Literacy is more important than conference, and so free books available in real time on a global scale online will always trump going into debt for a few hours a week in conference for just four years. A lifetime of affordable literacy, from cradle to death, has the potential to shake up society in ways very few people realize. Let's all benefit from ubiquitous free public libraries instead of ubiquitous expensive colleges.

## #18 - Don't Lock Yourself Into Proprietary Licenses by Using Non-Open Source Textbooks

I look at paid books the same way I look at non-open source programs: I'm pretty skeptical after years of horrible return on investments with them.

For example, in college I studied Max/MSP for my studio art classes while completing my art degree, but after graduating in 2008 during the recession I quickly discovered that I couldn't even budget enough to afford to buy myself a copy of the software. I had spent years learning to program in this language, only to find in the "real world" outside of life as a student I couldn't even use it! I sort of laugh about it now, comparing it to learning a programming language that has a $500 licensing fee to use. Why would I ever use a programming language that is proprietary? Yet there I was, in debt from a liberal arts degree smack in the middle of the great recession and not even able to afford to purchase the software I had spent years learning in hopes of having a career creating music with it. It was sort of a learning lesson: Never use non-open source software in your creation pipeline. People are all too willing to slap a gigantic licensing fee that simply exceeds the return on investment that people usually earn by using the software itself. The music I made using Max/MSP basically earned me nothing, yet I was expected to pay for $500 software with updates that cost hundreds of dollars and the entire ecosystem was proprietary. It's kind of like professional sports: There are very few people who can use proprietary software, which costs hundreds of dollars if not thousands, and make money with it. The odds of doing something in the art fields with proprietary software and making money from it are about the same odds as becoming a professional sports player. It's just horrible odds.

I now look at books in much the same way, realizing that throughout college the pattern seemed to be to buy these really expensive books (and I was fortunate as a liberal arts major, since I didn't buy textbooks but rather classics from penguin or oxford world classics, which are much cheaper) and use up all my money, so that when I later went to purchase a book for my own personal pleasure I usually overdrafted my debit card (this was before the days of cell phone bank statements). I have spent so many thousands of dollars on books over my lifetime, almost to the point that I found myself with student loans after college yet no money to buy the books that I needed to own in order to do my academic research I hoped to sell. Just like with Max/MSP, I had locked myself into an ecosystem that was only profitable to a few elite players, and otherwise was a money sink to anyone else. Buying books took a majority of my money, and the only alternative was to go to grad school in order to have access to their stacks. Books are basically proprietary software, and the upfront cost of them coupled with their closed copyright, makes them limited in your ability to earn money using them.

I now realize I have been wasting my times pursuing books, because they have never been open source. Whereas most classics are public domain, so that I could take my humanities courses much more affordably than other "core major" classes, college textbooks are a tremendous waste of time and resources. If you think you can make money using the "software" (books) in your academic discipline, why is that software not open source? Why are books not copyleft? Unfortunately I've come to the conclusion that the more proprietary your books are in your academic major, i.e. if you rely on expensive textbooks and books, the less likely it is that you can make money with the knowledge in those books. That is to say, if you aren't on a open source-only diet when it comes to reading books, you probably are isolating yourself into a proprietary walled garden that doesn't let you earn money by remixing their content. Much like the time I spent learning a non-open source programming language, studying non-open source textbooks is kind of like making your future self require licensing fees just to have the possibility to make money. Non open source books are mostly a scam.

I have little compassion for colleges due to their reliance on textbooks that cost $200+. For my intro to programming course, I laughed at the idea of paying $150 for a copy of the latest iteration of the book when I had already taught myself programming, as a seventh grader, for free online. I knew that there was little need for going into debt to such a extreme degree as $150 _for a BOOK_ when the internet and public library was there for me. To think that a single textbook could basically pay for an entire year of PluralSight is remarkable. So I instead bought the older version of the textbook for $15 used, and it contains nearly all the same information except for a single chapter on JavaFX (which I read from a friend).

But now I look back and I truly question why a beginning programming textbook at that college wasn't free. Fortunately my other alma mater, Reed College, decided to use an open source textbook for their intro to programming class (Composing Programs by John deNero). The way I think of it, if a private school can use open source textbooks, there's no reason a small public university should require a $150 textbook purchase. That type of money for a BOOK is ridiculous, especially considering the tremendous number of free open source programming textbooks professors could potentially use as an alternative. To expect students to pay $150 just to learn if statements and conditionals, really basic stuff, is reprehensible. In a way, it just shows how silly it is to attend college when there are so many open source educational resources. Why would a book cost $150? No information, especially computer science information, is worth that amount! Yes it pays to learn to program, but due to market competitivity of open source books, there are free options. Yet here we were, a college class with thirty students each buying a copy of the $150 textbook. I was the only person to use the $15 older edition.

To require students to spend $150 on a book just shows the absurdity of colleges nowadays. If there is anything that is unsustainable on face value, it is an attempt to negate the momentum that open source has and bury your head in the sand and keep requiring purchase of "software" with a proprietary license. Just like I couldn't afford Max/MSP, I couldn't afford going back to college to study computer science even though that's what I wanted to do. The costs were simply too astronomical. I realized that the only option I had was to study open source or affordable edtech, but I quickly realized that it was actually a better learning experience too. I was learning marketable skills that I wouldn't have learned in the university, all for free in a way that allowed me to keep studying far past the limitations of a single class' homework and time allocation. I knew that I was enabling myself to be a computer scientist in perpetuity, rather than having my career "blockaded" when I couldn't afford the proprietary software licenses and its required yearly upgrades. Instead of programming in a closed source ecosystem, I was using open source to earn money rather than hemorrhaging it. To invest your time in anything other than open source educational technology is a truly dangerous endeavor, one that risks an end result of a zero return on investment.

That's why I'm not sorry to see websites like Library Genesis take a stab at an industry ripe for disruption, the same way the music industry was with Napster. I'm glad I can listen to music on my iphone-ipod through the mobile internet without a clunky cd, just like I'm glad I can read a Library Genesis rip on my ipad through the mobile internet without hauling around clunky paper. To think of all the times I overdrafted buying an expensive book for a college class literally makes me hate the publishing industry, at least superficially. When I see Amazon develop a kindle ebook delivery system but only charge a few dollars less than the deadwood edition when it should cost just a dollar or two in total, I realize what a scam the proprietary-license book industry is. To think that they will receive an industry-wide disruption thanks to Library Genesis is sort of schadenfreude-inducing. I think they've made themselves rich off non-bankruptable student loans and a climate of mandatory college, and we're facing the cost as an entire nation when a whole generation of kids have trillions of dollars of student loans.

So I wonder what I can do to promote the OER industry in computer science (and other academic departments). I hope for a future that publishing a book without an open source license is as absurd as developing non-open source software today. Open source is a great system that truly utilizes the free markets to maximize human pleasure and profit, so the more it sinks into other industries than programming, the better. The future world of free books will be a welcome development rather than the previous world of overdrafts and debt due to having to buy required textbooks on top of pleasure reading. Reading was hard enough in the past that I break into cold sweat thinking about just how challenging it use to be as someone that read books, and to think it could all get so much easier with open source books is beautiful.

I propose you follow a pledge just like I do: when it comes to acquiring new programming skills, prioritize open source educational resources as your first line of research. Only use proprietary EdTech, like Treehouse, PluralSight, and Lynda, when you find it necessary and you've exhausted OER. Otherwise use OER (and your public library, including Library Genesis) to accomplish your educational goals. You'll find without the debt and the sealing yourself off from future use due to enormous licensing fees, you'll be able to develop more open source software because you yourself won't have to rely on proprietary licenses to recuperate your losses from spending a lot of money learning to code. Open source basically propagates open source, just like frugality propagates financial independence. If you avoid proprietary ecosystems including non-free books, you'll be set for life at making a profit in computer science at no cost to you.

Don't use non-open source programming languages, whether that takes the form of software or actual paper books! You might just lock yourself into a lifetime of debt rather than profit.


## #17 - The Barebone Baseline Degree Manifesto


There must be a baseline for people considering going to college. That baseline must be the most affordable means of earning a computer science degree in America. At the current moment, that is the $4000 OER-based University of the People degree.

I hope eventually this baseline will go even lower. Perhaps more nonprofits will fine even more ways of competing with UoPeople's price tag. I am skeptical, however. I don't see many more modifications possible to trim any fat from UoPeople. It's quite elegant in its current form, and one reason I'm a big fan.

However, there has to be a real world change due to the innovation of UoPeople. Students must refuse to pay more than $4000 for a degree, regardless of the "prestige" of the university. If any university will wind up costing more than $4000, then the student must choose UoPeople over it. You might think I'm crazy for proposing this, but I believe it to be a central tenant of Holm Schooling. Don't pay more than $4000 for a CS degree.

Of course, that means you basically have to get a full ride to a public university in your hometown. I see no reason to view this as a downside. I think the sort of work ethic that earns you a full ride scholarship to a local public university is the same type of work ethic that creates future important computer scientists. You might say I'm being resistant to easy mistakes and foibles made but young students, but I would respond by saying there is a perfect solution for students that fall into such a camp: University of the People for $4000.

College should be free for anyone who works hard enough in college. That free can be gradiated to being either private university for the really hard workers, public university for the less hard workers, and community college for the other students. I think this is a reasonable expectation, because I think going into debt to study computer science when you can do it so easily and productively online for free is personal finance suicide. Debt when you're young costs something like 32 times what the sticker price is when you're sacrificing investing in index funds at a young age. Writing yourself out of compounding interest earned while young is committing yourself to a lot more hard work than anyone should ever have to face. Unfortunately most kids today are not disgusted by high tuition costs, they instead view it as proof of the quality of a prestigious degree. That is false and simply not true.

Computer Science doesn't care if you have a prestigious degree. There is nothing that will close doors due to having a lack of an expensive degree if you can do the required work. It is very easy to demonstrate ability in computer science, it's completely transparent (github) and just takes the little effort of making a portfolio website. If you can't make a portfolio website, you probably aren't skilled enough to be a computer scientist. I am not being elitist in saying that, I am suggesting that kids stop worrying about what elite school they get into and focus instead of teaching themselves how to program affordably through OER/OCW/public libraries.

It used to be that a public university would cost $4000 total (even considering inflation). That's no longer the case, and the only way costs will come down is if students refuse to pay more than the cost of the cheapest CS degree in America. The brilliance of UoPeople is that it is entirely scalable due to ability -- anyone can breeze through the required reading then hit it harder on more and more OER thanks to github repos like [EbookFoundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books) (not including Library Genesis or your local public library). The sky is the limit because we are now at the point in which even a graduate level education in computer science is available online. In that way, you are no longer obligated to pay for facilities like a library. That sort of stuff has "melted into the air" of github and LibGen. That's just a fact of modernity. It is not particularly productive to deny it or resist it in any particular way. It new, and a little paradigm shifting, but it's ultimately "good" and probably going to improve your life if you embrace it.

I believe in competitivity, and I believe that university costs should always be competitive to what is the most accessible and affordable option. The degree of "prestige" associated with the school holds zero competivity in a meritocratic realm such as computer science. Competitivity should be evaluated at a financial level, not a social stigma level. I don't believe in stigma for using OER (it doesn't matter if you learn to program through a free OER or a $200 textbook as long as you can do what is required of you as a programmer). I don't believe that the stigma against not having a prestigious degree will prevent you from having a successful career, especially in such an in-demand field as computer science. I think what is unfortunate is risking having a very low net worth just because you paid a lot of money for a degree. I think frugality will be less stigmatized as this generation fails to prepare for their retirement, and the math starts showing itself to the public.

Colleges try to make it seem like you'll make a lot of money getting a degree from them. I don't remember this exactly, but I know my expectation for earning a degree from a private university was that I would easily pull down $100,000 a year as a professional. That wasn't at all my case, and I was applying to Chipotle at thirty instead of having a well paying job. College prestige is 100% marketing, which plays off social fears and prejudices by young but competitive people. There was nothing I learned at my college that I couldn't have learned at my public library, and that was even before the invention of Library Genesis. While I am referencing a liberal arts degree in this paragraph, the same is true for computer science degrees. What is most important is that you're committed to working hard and learning CS fundamentals instead of chasing after the promise of higher salaries that elite colleges make you believe you will earn in exchange for their outrageous pricetags. Since most learning is self-directed, the return on your investment is in your hands, not the university. For a fraction of the cost, you can transfer than investment in yourself with a UoPeople degree, and still come out with the same skill set.

Competition should come not from the prestige of the college you get into, but by the affordability of the university you attend. Shifting that focus will reward you by ensuring that you can become financially independent as soon as possible, instead of becoming as prestigious as soon as possible. Prestige is a false hope, and if you buy into its dominant narrative that pervades America, you are sacrificing financial independence. FI comes from being competitive in frugality and hard work, not from buying your way to supposed success. In that way, I don't think anyone should pay more than $4000 for a CS degree.

The nice thing about $4000 is that you can pay for it working roughly three hours a week at minimum wage for four years, and you can graduate debt free. Not having to work will allow you more time to study, which will grant you more access to the type of advanced topics that are expected of successful computer scientists. It's a win-win situation: You stand to become financially independent sooner, and you also have more time to become a competent computer scientist. The belief that you need a prestigious degree to become a competent computer scientist disintegrates at the simple searching of any elite university's syllabus's required reading on Library Genesis. It's no longer a matter of access, it's a matter of personal drive (aided by greater free time not being in debt at any point in your life).

Not being in debt at any point in your life is the ultimate "unlocked achievement" in the game of life, because it lets you buy your freedom. Buying your freedom is so much more important than buying your prestige, that I created this site to try and convince you of it. Maxing out your 401k and IRA while you're young is the ticket to freedom, and this typically can only be done with frugality and zero debt. Public library, both bricks & mortar and digital, help you achieve that freedom.

I'm willing to be a little harsh and be blunt here: Paying more than $4000 for a CS degree is stupid in the day and age of UoPeople. You may scoff initially and say that's ridiculous, but I suggest you watch a few documentaries and books on open source software. Just like open source is eating software, open source education is eating universities. The day and age of student debt is over, now you can pay for a university degree in computer science for a few hours of minimum wage work a week while you're studying. That's quite remarkable, and one reason I hope philanthropists will sweeten the pot even more and sponsor UoPeople scholarships ([F-You Degrees](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html)) through local public libraries for just a couple million dollars per town. People will say value over price tag, but since education is so self-directed anyway to make it almost not even a product, sometimes price tag wins when mixed with commitment and hard work. It's stupid to pay more than $4000 for a CS degree in 2019.

If you win scholarships that makes a brick and mortar university cheaper than $4000, then by all means take it and go and work your affordable little butt off. If you missed the boat (which requires almost military precision to accomplish from a very young age), you're better off going with the most affordable school that isn't a scam or degree mill. I hope that you take the opportunity that four years of debt-free time affords you and study YOUR little affordable butt off. Computer science is a great field to work in, particularly because open source has little tolerance for prestige when meritocracy is on the line. Good software needs good developers, and fortunately becoming a good developer doesn't require much more than zero dollars in 2019.

The Barebone Baseline Degree Manifesto says you should always go with the most affordable university option. If you can't even afford $4000, fortunately you can just rely on OER/OCW and your local public library. The notion that good things only come from high price tags needs to die in a fire. As Holm Schoolers we are aware that open source has created an entire field of open education, and the energy and momentum behind it has matched if not surpassed traditional bricks and mortar education. Prestigious degrees are only worth it if they cost less than the Barebone Baseline Degree. Fortunately, that baseline is only $4000. You should celebrate for the future of humanity. No longer will an entire generation be swarmed with tens of thousands of dollars of student loans at a young age, and they instead can invest in index funds with their zero debt. Computer science makes a $4000 degree possible, and computer science will continue to enhance the lives of computer scientists willing to research a bit more behind high expenses, bubbles, and consumer debt in all forms.

I think if you have the ability to work a couple more hours a week while you're studying, you can find success with a [F-You degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html). I think sacrificing much more than this is a folly. Believe me when I say if you believe the prestige bait, you will get hooked and put on the line for an immense debt that prevents you from gaining financial independence. With greater knowledge about financial independence through free and open dialogue on contemporary FI blogs and OER, we're finally finding solutions to problems that plagued an entire generation oblivious to the bubble in higher education. Bubbles pop, and that popping is the realization that the bait wasn't a real minnow but a faux worm that results in your fast-impending financial debt. It's unfortunate that the culprit is a government institution like public universities, but the buyer must be aware of bubbles and avoid them at all cost. Talking about bubbles and creating educational curricula on bubbles (as I hope Holm School will do) is a great solution to rising bubbles. Experiment with solutions proposed by FI bloggers (particularly computer scientists, which a majority of them are) and find a way to dodge the tempting bait and recognize it as a hook instead of sustenance. Trying to fly past the Barebone Baseline Degree and score more worms is playing with fire. Keep it baseline, and avoid the bubble. It will cause better solutions to the bubble to be invented, as UoPeople has done and will probably continue to do for the near future. The only other solution which requires zero debt at all is Library Genesis. Soon that will be reified through a legal Spotify for Books, and that invention will cause the bubble to lose its appeal to naive young children.

I'm not a fan of institutions that profit off the naivity of children. I grew up a PBS kid and I never saw the value of treating kids in a way that deviates from Mr. Rogers. Colleges act like degenerate forms of Mr. Rogers, promising drunken revelries and a libertarian party scenes with no legal threat for the participant. Instead of serving as the role of Mr. Rogers, public universities serve in the role of the Cool Uncle who owns a strip club. That needs to stop, and responsibility needs to be taken by students not to be enticed into self-harming activity, all for a cheap attempt at saying F-You to [strict parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVOOwFNp5U).

Best of luck to you regardless of if you take my advice or not. My advice here at Holm School: be frugal even in regards to education, be a vegan straightedger, and invest in index funds. Let's see what we can accomplish if we do this as a community.

## #16 - Supply and Demand are Reversed for College Degree Prices

I have a pet theory that supply and demand are reversed when it comes to the pricing of a degree. Because some degrees are by all accounts valueless (anyone can read the set of books on the curriculum for free at their public library or on LibGen, and I'm particularly thinking of the liberal sciences), something must be driving the absurd cost of these degrees, such that people are going into debt in order to obtain valueless degrees. It works this way: As degrees become worthless in the marketplace due to political issues and wasted resources, the degree costs actually rise because the universities realize that only desperate people want these sort of liberal arts degrees. Since it's valueless, and people still want them, there is less obligation to lower the price because demand is so low.

I test this out by proposing the example of UoPeople. A computer science degree is so valuable that you can basically get away with paying very little because it's not a waste of time. Since it's not a waste of time, there isn't a high price attached to it. So many people have committed their time to making computer science educations affordable that the glut corresponds to barebone prices. Since no one makes any effort to, say, make a sociology education affordable, there is no effort to make sociology degrees affordable. No one has any money in sociology to create OER because no one makes enough money to contribute to charity. No to mention that demand is so low for jobs that sociologists don't want to promote people earning sociology degrees, as that would actually create competition for their potential future jobs.

I think the more valuable a degree is to a person and to society, the more affordable it will be. That's a bit of a reversal of supply and demand, but that's ultimately the effect that open source has on software: the greater the demand, the more likely it is to be open sourced. People can't get away with charging high prices for a good/degree when there is an open source alternative. There are no open source educations for liberal arts degrees, the whole gamut is proprietary and copyrighted and obscured behind digital paywalls. People don't contribute liberal arts books to Library Genesis. Liberal arts books are expensive, and there's no "Safari Books" for sociology. It's a losing proposition, the effort behind OER fades because the field becomes irrelevant and unnecessary ultraleft, and the cost to learn the curriculum goes up in price because demand is so low for anyone in the know.

In education, supply and demand can sort of pinpoint you in what you should pursue. Considering UoPeople started out offering a computer science degree, there is a good chance computer science is the most opportune major to choose. Though people think paying a couple thousand dollars for a degree from UoPeople shows how crappy of a school it is, I actually think what is demonstrates is how robust high-demand fields are in creating a world of affordable education. Especially when that world consists of people going a hundred thousand dollars in debt for a sociology degree. If you're education isn't affordable, the chances are you aren't going to have much luck finding a job in that field. High price for college degrees aren't proof that the field has a robust future, it actually signals its encroaching death. Just like private universities bit into your savings at a young age that could be put into index funds if you had saved money and went to community college, the cost to the person is so enormous that demand for the degree plummets. People basically begin to pay for the degree, because so few people will pay them to study it. No one teaches affordable education in the field because no one is financially secure enough to produce OER. No universities can create affordable online degrees, a la UoPeople, because public schools aren't "good enough" for the few jobs there are in the field, so people are basically forced to "purchase" their future job by paying a lot for a private university degree. It's a bad spiral, and one of the reasons I'm not surprised college costs so much. People getting valueless degrees because they don't want to study STEM but still want to go to college when the public library would suffice for their job training basically creates an unsustainable feedback loop. And part of unsustainability is non-market driven supply and demand curves. It's 100% bubble.

The bubble of the liberal arts is demonstrated in the way that you can get a [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) for $5200 but you would have to pay 12 times that for a silly art history degree. If you choose to pay $70,000 for a liberal arts degree when you could have got a STEM degree for $5200, you are basically buying into a bubble. The bubble is the broken supply-demand curve, where the low demand for liberal arts majors causes the price of a liberal arts degree to soar. The bubble is that even though private universities strip you of your potential savings at age 22 when you graduate, costing you millions of dollars in opportunity cost when compounded for 40 years at 10% earnings, people still will go to private university instead of community college. The way people are throwing away millions of dollars chasing broken supply-demand curves just because of the perceived prestige of the product is the perfect definition of a bubble. The bubble is going to burst and if you're not able to program in the 21st century, the question will be what were you studying at age 18-22 instead? Even liberal arts majors need to learn how to program, and that's why I believe if you want to be a liberal arts major, a computer science degree is a great degree and training for a liberal arts job. A computer scientist can get a liberal arts job any day of the week, but a liberal arts major can't get a computer science job. And most jobs in the future will be computer science jobs.

If you are paying a lot for a degree, it's worth considering if you aren't buying into a bubble. Any potential earning gains by having a private college degree will be offset by the debt you are left to pay at the end of your tenure at college, resulting in something like a million dollars of opportunity cost. The benefits of a bubble are very small, and it's best to abscond from their presence rather than running towards them. If you resist teaching yourself CS through OER, F-You Degrees, and your public library, then you are not on the reverse supply-demand curve for educational costs that say the increased demand for a degree results in lower prices. If you fail to heed that the curve is reversed in education, then you are blissfully unaware that you are walking headfirst into a bubble. When the bubble bursts, you're left holding the bags with a degree you could have gotten for $4000 bucks.

When it comes to college costs, the more in-demand your degree is, the closer to free it will be. In computer science's case, the affordability comes down to community colleges/public unversities, which will still get you jobs, or even UoPeople if you don't have a college in your hometown, or even just OER/public library/LibGen if you don't even want to pay for UoPeople. The job is so in-demand, you'll still get a job as long as you put four years of hard work into it, no matter what the final pricetag. The less debt you have, the more you can start maxing out your 401k and IRA in index funds at age 22, setting you up to become financially independent.

## #15 - The Conflict of Interest Between Professor and Student

Most people who enter academia want to become teachers in a similar institution. The hope is the more prestigious of a university they attend, the more likely they can teach at a prestigious university. My main concern about this tendency is that after attending university, I realize that I would never want to teach at a university because of how expensive it is to people who attend it. I think education should be free (or at least a couple of hundred dollars max a year). The idea of teaching kids is great, but not when those same kids are on the hook for a hundred thousand dollars in loans (as they would be at a private university). This seems like a crappy job, not at all a prestigious job (even if it does come with tenure). It's almost like an MLM scheme, where you're aware that only those at the top make money and all the proles at the bottom hold the bags and are left with all the debt. So, you might say, just work at a public university. The problem with that is that I would still require a prestigious private university degree (one in which I can't at the moment afford, and would never want to pay anyway). The other problem is that even public university students are finding themselves in massive amount of student debt. So even public university, for all its accolades, is still presently too expensive compared with what can be learned affordably online.

I think debt at a young age is extremely detrimental and should avoided at all costs, especially when savings at that age compounds something around 2^5 (using the rule of 72 and a 10% index fund return: 38 years/7.2 = 2^5.27) by the time you retire. So college actually ends up costing you 36 times what its sticker cost is. If you can teach yourself to program online (which you can very well given the amount of OCW/OER/cheap training sites), you can instead EARN those 36 times gains for your retirement instead of sacrificing them. Since I feel that so persuasively, why should I expend my energies pursuing the qualifications to become a university professor? I would be required to work in a profession that is robbing young people of their retirement. I would have to promote going to college instead of warning against it, economics-wise. At this point, I have declared myself something of a "collegial independent," and that is qualified both for as a student and as a professor. Do I really want to rob children of 36 times what they're paying for, when they could be investing that money in VTSAX instead? Heck no, and part of promoting Holm Schooling is promoting personal finance literacy along with OER literacy, so I can't in good faith promote paying a lot of money to go to university when you can teach yourself anything online. I'm not even convinced a $4000 University of the People degree is worth the cost, although that does open some cool doors like the $7000 GATech OMSCS Master's Degree, so I'm willing to promote it as a sane solution to high school costs using OER (the same resources I promote for affordable learning).

Part of the fun of this job is the realization that I will receive zero compensation for my promotion of OER and online learning. There is zero reward for my work. No one is going to pay me to promote going to the most affordable college offer you get, whether that's a local community college or UoPeople. Or whether that's teaching yourself online and only enrolling in university when you're on your company's tuition reimbursement benefit payroll (making a college and master's degree, and your entire education up to that point, free). All of my writing and works are public domain, making compensation for my work very unlikely, for the good of open source. It's pretty cool knowing that I'm not monetizing my blog with ads or recommending credit cards in order to earn a couple hundreds of dollars a month. Holm School is completely public domain, top to bottom. I believe if you are not using open source resources in your computer science education, you are locking yourself into a debtors prison which you can only buy your way out of when it's time to actually do computer science. And the cost to do that is immense, even if you might have the notion that proprietary education is for the good of humanity, etc. It's just a business like any other, and if there are options to use open source it is risky not to use it, since you can never buy yourself out of a proprietary license and it limits your future. Open source is probably going to become more dominant in all aspects of life, because it is a paradigm created for the internet by the internet.

I don't want to promote going to any school that costs more than a $5200 [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html). If you earn a scholarship that lets you go to a hometown college for less than that, then congratulations, you should definitely do that. But if you didn't, a F-You Degree is a really good option to open doors to the OMSCS masters degree as well as a junior dev job. And you can pay for it for around 3 hours of minimum wage labor a week during the time you're a student, meaning zero debt. All other hours of your life should be dedicated to learning to program as fast as possible. Rather than going to a university which requires electives which, while enlightening, are a waste of time that could be spent learning how to program, and they certainly aren't free (whereas your local public library, which suffices in resources for a liberal arts degree equivalent in reading, is). Skim the fat and only take CS/Math classes if you're paying for public university classes. You can get a job at the end of four years even without a degree and use your tuition reimbursement to finish off the degree online (possibly at UoPeople) after the fact, continuing on with an OMSCS.

I do not want to be a professor at a university, even if I had a PhD. I want to become a professor at Holm School, where tuition is free and the textbooks are free and open source instead of $200. I think this will be the prominent paradigm for affordable education henceforth, offering affordable degrees (a la UoPeople) or otherwise crowd sourcing affordable CS education (a la PluralSight/Treehouse/Lynda/SafariBooks, where costs are amortized over thousands of users to the point that even public libraries can afford subscription fees). In this universe, which is new and quite crazy, placing myself in a traditional bricks and mortar institution would be a tremendous mistake. We're at the point in which volunteer professors suffice for the staff for UoPeople classes, saving costs. We're at the place in which an entire school has decided to use OER, which means students don't have to pay a cent for textbooks from freshman to senior year. We're at a place in which Library Genesis lets anyone read the same textbooks used at private universities for free, anywhere in the world. You don't need a physical stack anymore. We're at a world in which an entire training series in various programming languages are just $25 a month at Treehouse, or even free if your public library subscribes to them as mine does. You can get a job doing web development for zero expense at your public library. Lynda comes pretty close if you don't have Treehouse (and most people have Lynda). Mix that with a liberal study of OpenCourseWare and OER to make sure you get the computer science/algorithms fundamentals rather than just programming training and you have everything needed to get a job with zero educational costs.

I would be crazy to go into a job in academia at this point. It's been open sourced and put online for free. I obviously would get a better salary in academia, but is that guaranteed considering how much of a bubble it is? When the student debt crisis crashes the economy once the bubble bursts, is all the work and debt for getting an academy job really going to be a good job continuing forward? Or would that be promoting the wrong thing, focusing on the wrong solutions for an extensive problem, writing myself out of the future? That's my belief, and one of the reasons I'm working on Holm School in my free time rather than getting the degrees necessary to become a professor. I hope my side hustle pays off in terms of influence rather than monetization, because I think many people aren't aware that you can boostrap a great career in CS for very low costs (even if the amount of work is immense -- which is good). This isn't true in all STEM fields, just computer science, but people need to know they don't need to take out non-bankruptable student loans to learn CS. Considering most CS jobs pay tuition reimbursement, it might be more strategic to study online for free towards a first job, then focus on earning your degrees while working. With UoPeople and OMSCS, this is possible.

Considering UoPeople professors are volunteer, I don't feel bad never earning anything from Holm School. Rather than teaching at UoPeople, I teach at Holm School towards the same cause -- affordable education in computer science by using and creating OER. Though I don't make any money, it's great knowing no one is going into debt in order to learn here. I hope to contribute to OER and continue and promote the legacy of all the authors that have [open sourced their CS textbooks](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books). Computer science is unique in the world of STEM in that it does not require any labs or equipment other than a Raspberry Pi to learn. I wish that were true of other STEM disciplines, and while we've made progress towards that thanks to Library Genesis, at the moment there doesn't seem to be much hope of becoming a professional scientist in any of the other STEM departments without a university education. But that doesn't apply to CS, in which university-equivalent training is open source and online, and we should exploit that unique situation as much as we can and avoid student loans seeing as they are apparently unnecessary. Considering how important I consider personal finance to computer scientists, I am not at all interesting in entering a workforce that compromises CS students' personal finance at an early age by saddling them with student loans. If Holm Schooling can get a person a job with very low up front costs, then I am comfortable not earning a penny from their misunderstandings about CS education. I'm not looking to exploit anyone, especially young innocent kids who just want to be computer scientists, as I have since seventh grade. I wasn't looking to go $70,000 in debt at age 23 for this dream, I am only now recuperating that cost at age 34. This old and expensive way of doing things needs to be replaced, and now with Library Genesis and other EdTech, not to mention your public library, it is finally possible. So I am promoting what I know concerning this with Holm School. The most important factor in your education concerning CS is time, not prestige, and you can have more time to study CS if you keep costs low (talking hundreds of dollars a year) so that you aren't obligated to find work to pay off your loans. Imagine getting a F-You Degree ($5200), followed by an OMSCS degree ($7000). After basically 6-7 years of study and earning yourself a master's degree, you're only $13,000 in debt. $13,000 over 7 years is roughly $1,742 a year, or basically 5 hours of minimum wage work a week to cover the cost. That's minimal time commitment for a student and very doable, meaning you could get a master's degree in CS with zero debt at the end. That's immense and practically impossible at a brick and mortar university. It's a wild time to be alive if you're an 18 year old who wants to be a computer scientist. Graduating with a Master's degree for zero debt is a wonderful opportunity. My undergraduate could have funded 6 F-You + OMSCS degrees. That's food for thought. The old way of doing things is something I want no part in, even as a paid professor, especially as I consider myself getting burned from the old way as a student, rather than flourishing because of it.

There is a terminal conflict of interest between the professor and the student. This is similar to the conflict of interest between a financial advisor and a client. Do they operate on commission? Are they a fiduciary? Are they able to give financial advice in the client's best interest when they themselves are looking to profit the most? As Jim Collins says, that requires a certain saintly person. I think those saintly people are found in the people who volunteer as profs for UoPeople. I also think the conflict of interest extends to professors, who in a way are basically financial advisors regarding education. They hope to make the most money off their knowledge, and part of having that edge is having the client have as little knowledge as possible so that they can maintain their necessity. Having the edge seems to be a good thing, but part of that "edge" requires teaching a lot from lecture, and lectures are ultimately recordable and able to be put on YouTube. In a way, the very edge that suggests you should pay a lot of money requires that the tutelage be oral through lectures, which immediately means in this day and age anyone can capture it with an iphone and put it on YouTube for anyone else to view for free. That's sort of thing you see with financial independence blogs, in which JLCollinsNH puts his [Stock Series](https://jlcollins.nh.com/stock-series) online for free for anyone to read, and that sort of five hours of study trumps the investing advice financial advisors can give. If an advisor doesn't recommend index funds, you should probably run away. And likewise, if a professor doesn't recommend dropping out of college if it is expensive and studying on your own through OER/OCW/LibGen, then you should probably run away. There is a huge conflict of interest between new technology and the old technology that drives investment of time and money in brick and mortar colleges.

How far should this conflict of interest be analysed? Well personally I don't think it's very reasonable to assume that students should be on the hook for funding an entire professor's salary when they are one of a hundred or so students that take their classes in a semester. That's a tremendous burden financially. We need redundancy through technology that permits a wide pool of students who aren't necessarily tied to in-person interactions that can source their tuition together in order to pay for the one professor's salary. That's the sort of thing we see in OpenCourseWare, where a professor's salary to create OCW can be paid through YouTube advertisements or perhaps through donations. It's also what PluralSight does, in that thousands of people pay for PS whereas only a few "professors" create content, allowing for affordability for the student but teachers can actually earn a lot due to the technological redudancy (Scott Allen earns a million dollars a year being a PS teacher).

Professors who promote the bricks and mortar, 25 student classes are a conflict of interest to modern students. A professor should be finding ways to digitize their content and put it on the internet for millions of people to consume. Those millions of people can then pay the professor's salary through small tuition fees (PluralSight) or else even watching ads (YouTube OCW). If you are paying a professor for in-person tutelage, you might want to consider paying a professor instead who creates Open Source Course Ware. That will be much smaller in cost if you find a way to pool together many people who are interested in that content around the world. It also keeps with the "DRY" (Dont Repeat Yourself) principle in that you don't need thousands of professors teaching the same thing repeatedly in person, you can find one person to teach it online through video (or textbook) who open sources it. That's the idea behind Khan Academy and high school/intro college course material. That's what you find in OpenCourseWare too. That's why I think focusing Holm School around aggregating open source video and texts is a way to escape that conflict of interest and create content for people learning open source without requiring a professor's salary. I can do this for free after work. I don't require subscriptions, god forbid. That's the magic of open source and the way, I promise you, people will teach themselves to program in ten years. I'm trying to build the infrastructure that allows for this completely free education to flourish in regards to computer science. The traditional bricks and mortar model simply doesn't work for lowering prices, and that's why the old way is a conflict of interest, since people involved try to sap as much money from naive students, just like non-fiduciary investment advisors try and do with commission-based recommendations.

If there was an organization that granted "fiduciary" status to EdTech, I'd be enrolled. I don't think that exists, but the standard that might suffice is whether the EdTech is open source or not. There's a lot to be said for using open source licensing in creating educational resources, and the influence of this (at the moment) niche domain is really going to expand in the oncoming years. Public libraries can help, since they offer resources like Lynda free for patrons, and sites like Holm School can aggregate more open-sourced-focused operations hidden on various corners of the internet. At the moment I am able to run everything I want to do with regards to Holm School for free on Github, so I don't need to ask for any donations. That keeps my conflict of interest low -- all the edtech I promote is free or infinitely more affordable than college. As a wannabe fiduciary, I only promote edtech that I see as in the client's best interest and I certainly don't receive any compensation for Holm School from companies. Holm School is fiduciary, though I'm not certified by any body. Just my humble motive.

If I were a financial advisor, I would suggest my clients read JLCollinsNH's "Simple Path to Wealth" and control their Vanguard account themselves. If I were a professor, I would suggest to my students they read OCW/OER if they are paying more than a couple hundred bucks a year for college, and control their student debt themselves by avoiding it completely and investing the difference in Vanguard. I probably wouldn't last long in either position, but I don't need to worry about it because that's the sort of job shift you're seeing thanks to open source technology. It's kind of like automation: financial advisors and professors have been automated thanks to the ease of creating digital open source educational content (or setting up an account in Vanguard, etc). That's what having a fiduciary role means: you put the client's best interest in all circumstances. College is great if it is free or the lowest cost possible out of all your options, but anything beyond the barebone baseline risks leaving you with debt at an age you should be socking money into your 401k and IRA's index funds at your first junior dev job. Do professors act as fiduciary? I'm not trying to smear them, by any means, but you do have to admit there is a conflict of interest between earning as high of salary as possible off of student's continued participation in your curricula, and trying to do at little harm to the student as possible. The convincing of students to remain in college for years, paying high tuition in an attempt to earn a little more job security as long as the students keep enrolling and believing the hype. The best option to avoid this conflict of interest is to have an endowment that pays for all the costs of the college (obviously an online one), and have the students pay only as much as possible to meet the supply of (online) professors. This is probably going to happen through UoPeople someday, if more philanthropists get involved and pump up the endowment. At least it lends itself to scaling well, since it uses open source technology and makes its curricula using OER. That's also what you see with OpenCourseWare, in which MIT's endowment allows them to produce OCW on YouTube and eating the cost for the social benefit. Endowments, when harnessed towards open source ends, can indeed be powerful. That's assuredly what we'll see out of OpenStax as they pay professors to produce more open source textbooks too using their endowment.

Meditate over the potential conflict of interest between professor and student. Is having a non-bankruptable student loan between the two of you a situation in your best interest? Or is it a bit of a golden handcuff? Can a professor lead you on a professional track that benefits from early job placements, versus a track that encourages many years of non-working, focusing on academic studying at the expense of not earning a salary? Does a professor really want you to avoid going into debt, when that debt pays their salary? Find a way to break that conflict of interest. I hope Holm School can help you in a fiduciary way to avoid the downsides of the non-fiduciary role of college staff. Be wise and become "OER-literate," just like learning about financial independence, so you aren't losing out on thousands of dollars in advisor fees and expense ratios (so to speak).

## #14 - Don't Repeat Yourself (D.R.Y.) Applies to Colleges Too

There was a time when a public library in every town was a philanthropic goal of Andrew Carnegie. He built an entire network of public libraries across the United States. This was in pre-computer times, and as a result the modus operandus of his philanthropic goal was "Repeat Yourself" by sheer numbers. Quantity was goal #1. The more public libraries, the more "Universities of the People." A book needed to be put on the stacks in every single one of these public libraries. There was nothing digital about it, and accordingly it existed as bricks and mortar and lots of deadwood.

Now, with the internet, public libraries have changed. Instead of needing to be built in every town, a public library can exist on the internet. Rather than serving a single town and its surrounding citizens, a public library can serve an entire state if need be. No public library exists in this form that I'm aware of -- a completely online state public library -- but I wouldn't be surprised if that become the mode for new public libraries in the future. When tablet computers are so affordable they can be paid for by the sheer electricity saved driving to the public library, public library patrons can just check out books through an app.

Though the progress on this front is very slow (public libraries serve Overdrive on a purchased-book-by-purchased-book basis, and checkouts are artificially limited and the catalog still only serves a single town), I think we'll probably see a solution soon in the private sphere that will be so affordable that even public libraries can pay the subscription fees for their patrons. I write a lot about how university is becoming cheap enough that public libraries will be able to pay tuition on patron's behalf, but the same is true for digital books in my opinion. I think eventually we'll reach the place that subscriptions to books will be so affordable that the need to even rely on the public library will be comfortably met. I used to rip CDs from my public library in high school, but now my Apple Music subscriptions costs about $5 a month on a family plan, so that it's not even worth the electricity to drive to the public library to check out CDs. Let alone to go to the trouble to rip them. I get legal access to the entire catalog of published music for $5 a month (less than a lunch at my work's cafeteria). Because Spotify and Apple Music have basically "solved" the issue of legal streaming, the public library can probably cut back on their CD budget and instead focus on providing proprietary digital services like Lynda and Treehouse and Safari Books. While I don't suspect that we'll ever get free Spotify accounts through our public library, there is that possibility too in the oncoming decades. The educational value of a Spotify account isn't quite as defensible as a Treehouse account, in my opinion, but who knows what the future holds?

This analysis is a little too obtuse, and I'm being deliberate. Most kids can't afford a smart phone to use Spotify or Apple Music. But there's always a potential solution: Perhaps Spotify could offer an educational version of its software where as long as a patron is located on a public library's WiFi, they are able to stream Spotify (on a potentially borrowed tablet or computer). I think something like 90% of kids have smart phones these days, so maybe I'm concerned about something that doesn't need to be a concern. But public library computers could still access a digital music library in the future. A personal subscription for use on your personal computer(s) would just be an added benefit. After all, if you wanted to use microfiche, you could never take them home but had to use the personal projectors at the library. Something like that could work for music.

Let's talk about universities for a moment. The interesting thing about uni is that often time they try to replicate the success of Carnegie public libraries by being located in every town/city across the united states. There is probably a community college within driving range of nearly everyone in America. The shame about this is that, while "public," community colleges are not free. A public library is free to use. But a community college, beyond spending time at their library (and not checking anything out), the resources are behind a paywall. In essence, they are a Spotify or Apple Music -- probably not something you're going to get at your public library any time soon, but there's always the possibility of a free subscription sometime in the distant future. The problem with community college is that, like Carnegie public libraries, they don't exist in the digital. While community colleges do offer online classes, they are again behind an expensive paywall. Unfortunately, since colleges have proliferated across the U.S., they require a high upkeep cost to maintain and staff. There isn't any benefit, to the college, of offering online classes versus physical classes. They cost a lot of money to produce, since they aren't archiveable (and repeatable) and they are staffed by a professor. Most people point to this as a benefit, in that you're receiving live instruction from a tutor, but the question is, in my opinion, whether you even need a live tutor in the day and age of the internet's archive of most everything related to learning. Live tutors come at a premium, just like "live public libraries" in your hometown come at a premium (requiring philanthropy). Public libraries and universities exist on different economic models -- a public library exists due to philanthropy and taxes, and a public library lives off tuition (along with philanthropy and taxes).

But what's strange is that a university and a public library serve the same purpose: educating people. In that regard, why the duplication? Why serve a repeatable function, education, from two different points of attack? And that's why I believe a bricks and mortar universities won't be able to compete with public libraries in the future of education, since public libraries are able to go digital while universities are not. Since they can't function on the model of the free digital archive, colleges [are basically doomed to price themselves out of existence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/expert-predicts-25-percent-of-colleges-will-fail-in-the-next-20-years-2019-08-31/). In that the solution to monetary issues is committing to work in a digital archive, public libraries can easily accomplish that solution while colleges cannot.

Of course, there are attempts to create a digital archive of university. That is what Open Courseware is. But obviously as soon as you create a digital manifestation of a product, the principle of ["Don't Repeat Yourself,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) a colloquialism in software engineer, applies to your archive. There is no need to recreate the Open Courseware already achived. As soon as a competent professors creates competent OCW, there is no need to repeat the project. And likewise, as soon as OCW becomes as useful as in-the-flesh tutelage, there is no need to repeat in-the-flesh tutelage when there is OCW. And in my opinion, OCW is as competent as in-the-flesh classes. Sometimes you have to watch a couple OCWs on the same topic to get a broad understanding, but digital learning in my opinion is just as good as classes. If you have personal questions about your learning, you can just post to Stack Overflow and get an answer. All those services cost zero dollars, which means when you're young to don't have to go in debt since you don't even have a job. Going into debt when you don't have a source of income is a very dangerous bet, akin to gambling, and the notion that young kids need to gamble with vast sums of money just to get a certificate when an alternative, free online learning on the internet or through your public library, exists is such a simple solution to the problem of the opportunity cost of debt at a young age, when investing in index funds instead has the return of 32x the cost when compounded for 40+ years until retirement.

I think two efforts are indicative of the future of learning when "Don't Repeat Yourself" applies to digital educational resources. The first is Library Genesis, which is basically a global public library. I don't really anticipate the United Nations ever creating a universal public library, but I do eventually see the potential for the Federal government to create a nation-wide digital public library. What more likely will happen is that something like Perlego will be so affordable that even local public libraries can subscribe on their patron's behalf. Perlego is $150 a year which is half the cost of a Treehouse subscription, yet my public library still subscribes to Treehouse. If something like Perlego (a Spotify for textbooks), becomes a thing in the United States, with widespread adoption rather than passive aggressiveness from the textbook industry, there could be a legal solution to problem of illegality of Library Genesis. Personally I'm not 100% convinced that LibGen isn't just acting as a global public library, but I realize there can be compromise in the oncoming years. There will eventually be a "YouTube for Books" that passes legal inspection due to changing attitudes about file sharing, but that day is many decades off. In the meantime, Library Genesis and perhaps if Perlego is successful, suffices for educational books. As a public library that serves the entire globe, LibGen and Perlego only need to receive a donation of a scanned/OCR'd book once and that copy can be distributed to anyone in the world. Since there is no repeating of product on a global scale, maintenance costs are as low as server costs can be. Digital media exist without hindrances to copying. In this way, proliferation of books is an inevitable outcome in a world obsessed with schooling. In our case, a single server (LibGen or Perlego) is able to serve the entire world. There's zero need to reproduce the archive, you just need that single archive and a single point of entry, whether that's the web in LibGen's case or an app in Perlego's. In essence, the public library has gone global.

What is the benefit of a global public library? At the point in which every book is available on Perlego, just as every album is available on Spotify, the need of a deadwood archive at a local public library diminishes. As people realize they can download unlimited books each month for roughly the cost of driving to the public library, public libraries can be released from the burden of maintaining a massive deadwood archive on premise. They can offer alternative services that aren't readily available to most consumers, such as a Lynda or Treehouse subscription. Or even, they could offer online college classes. With greater available budgets, perhaps they could even subscribe to University of the People on their patron's behalf, so that they could get computer science degrees. With an affordable archive of every book ever written in the English language available at the tap of a button, the need to go to a bricks and mortar university dimishes. Just like "Don't Repeat Yourself," there is no need to access a university library when you already have every book kept within at your fingertips. There is no need to take a class when the topic is already covered in OpenCourseware for free online. The repeating, the consumption of a paid good when a free resource already exists, probably won't be as necessary in the future once everyone understands how digital libraries work. Just as YouTube is reshaping television and Netflix is reshaping movies, Library Genesis is reshaping college. This phase of humanity is just in its infancy, and is available only to those willing to meddle in legally dubious realms. But soon a legal service will come out, and the phase of humanity where every book ever written is affordably available online will come about.

When every educational book is affordably available, how soon will it take for college to be seen as redundant? In computer science, almost all undergraduate classes are covered by a prominent OCW, and there are many already-legal free computer science textbooks published as OER. There is already the infrastructure in place for free "college-equivalent" educations in computer science. It will only get better as a legal Library Genesis gets passed the legal rigmarole. This will affect other academic disciplines, but here I am focusing on computer science. Just like "Don't Repeat Yourself" is a principle in software engineering, "Don't Pay for Already Free Resources" will become a mantra in educational realms. I realize I'm not going to convince anyone not to study the same textbooks they study at MIT, Caltech, and Stanford if they want to be a good computer scientists, but realize that [debt at a young age costs 32x the sticker price](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-09-Ending-Thoughts.html#the-secrets-of-compounding-interest-from-a-programmers-perspective). Those prices aren't particulary necessary at the moment, when free OER that probably suffices exist. Those prices particularly aren't necessary when Library Genesis is a global public library. And thsoe prices especially aren't necessary in the future when a legal LibGen exists which is affordable enough that public libraries can subscribe. It's a remarkable educational landscape that the internet has enabled, and my hope at Holm School is to suggest ways that a personal can craft a successful career without any debt. Some people can't afford college. Some people can't afford textbooks. But the internet grants free computer science books to anyone willing to research a little, not to mention OCW. The internet grants a $4000 online bachelor's degree in CS at [UoPeople](https://uopeople.edu). Soon all these free resources will themselves be redundant due to advances in digital archives. Just like nobody needs to rip CDs from their public library after Spotify's creation, no one will need to read OER after an affordable "Spotify for Books" bestows a comprehensive archive of textbooks.

The question is, how soon will that happen? I am willing to bet sooner than later, and as such I'm not writing SciFi here at Holm School but literally trying to spread knowledge about "OER and OCW literacy." People need to know that college is already redundant, that free digital archives of textbooks and classes meet 99.99% of student's needs to grok computer science to get a first job. That's not even considering the monumentally useful free resources distributed by public libraries around the nation, like Lynda subscriptions. It's a ripe time for self-educators skeptical of the need to pay for bricks and mortar campuses and in-the-flesh tutelage. Divest yourself of the fear of online learning and you can reap great successes. A good internship will sometimes net you a free PluralSight account, and a good first programming job will net you tuition reimbursement. Why go into debt for a service that is provided free with most programming jobs? It seems... redundant...

Learning computer science for free isn't a pipedream awaiting future advances in technology. That reality is in the here and now, and it's only going to get better. Unfortunately colleges have priced themselves out of relevance due to neglecting the importance of going digital due to the internet. Since "Don't Repeat Yourself" applies to educational resources just as much as code, once a digital archive is created of computer science classes, the need to behave redundantly just disappears. And that archive exists, [it's hosted here on github](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html#further-studies), and that affordable digital archive (which suffices already) is only going to get more robust in the future. That's because education has become a sort of "code," it no longer is deadwood printing press media but digital code. Best practices emphasize that it shouldn't be repeatedly done when a well-written "function" suffices for future use. As such, OER/OCW and digital public libraries serve as a function versus copy-and-paste bricks and mortar colleges. They Don't Repeat, at a cost of the cleanliness of edit-once-here-for-situational-need. The function, which you only need to edit once to serve all instances, is studying OCW/OER and public library resources for free. The cleanliness of D.R.Y. code means avoiding student debt and having to work extra hours to pay it off instead of investing in index funds when there is literally zero need given modern coding practices. It's a newb mistake.

Just like programmers need to study coding best practices, students need to study OER literacy. It behooves their engineering goals. It behooves their future maintenance as humans and employees. It behooves their financial bottomline. With education moving on the graph of digital code these days, there is little need for repeating tutelage (at a significant cost) in every town around the country. A global public library/archive is enough. YouTube is enough. OER is enough. Let's get past the obsession with college as the only way to develop as an adult and understand that best practices are more important than immediate benefit. The student debt crisis affirms that current practices are leaving behind unmaintainable, unclean code.

## #13 - College: The Reverse Lemonade Stand

College is what I call a "reverse lemonade stand." Instead a bunch of adults supporting the "career aspirations" of a bunch of entrepreneurial kids slinging lemonade for 25 cents a cup,  those kids selling lemonades are instead supporting the career aspirations of a bunch of adults who should be their benefactor. It's a reversal of the lemonade stand. Instead of kind adults taking time out of their schedule to stop at a lemonade stand and give away a buck, adults are instead expecting kids, who are making about $2.50 an hour, to pay them. Kids, being kids, have no recourse but to sell lemonade. They don't have the skills to make products. But instead of giving the kids money to allow them to buy books or whatever, adults are instead requiring the kids pay them their profits from their lemonade stand.

I think it's pretty sad that all the professors and staff at universities are expecting a bunch of 18 year olds to pay their salary. Considering all the money kids that age is a minimum wage job, equivalent to a lemonade stand, it's pretty embarrassing that these adults expect a bunch of kids working a lemonade stand should give all their money to them. Instead of being independent, successful adults, who make a career by creating a product to sell to the masses, they instead expect a bunch of kids to sell a product instead and give their earnings to them in order to pay their salary. Kids, being kids, sell lemonade. They work at Target or Walmart or Starbucks. And then these professors, with no shame or guilt, expect these kids to fork over their quarters and dimes just to get them to read a book which they can otherwise read for free on the internet. Or do some programming tutorials they can otherwise learn free through their public library's Lynda account. Or read an expensive textbook, which as students they pay for another professor's salary along with their course's professor's salary too, for which they pay through selling lemonade for quarters and dimes.

Everything in college is a reversal of the adult->child hierarchy. Adults aren't funding kids, instead kids are funding adults. It's frankly embarassing that these adults, uncontent with their feat of exploiting young kids, want even more money, so they charge even more for classes and textbooks than any generation had to pay before. Instead of adults, through taxes or whatever, paying for kids' education, they kids are expected to pay for a handful of professor's careers in which they do nothing but write expensive textbooks or journal articles and teach beginning programming classes which kids can otherwise learn the same course material on YouTube. It's so sad that America has positioned its children in this way, expecting a bunch of 18 year olds to go into debt in order to furnish the lifestyles of some professors at the local university. Instead of paying kids to learn, kids are paying adults to write books that they in turn are required to purchase at exorbitant prices. It reminds me of [Company Scrips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_scrip), in which an employee is required to buy their goods at the company store. Company stores have been outlawed for good reason. I'm not sure why the reverse lemonade stand that is "college" keeps being allowed to exist.

If you want to make your living ripping off naive 18 year olds, be my guest, get a PhD and write your journal articles. But if you're a little uncomfortable requiring a bunch of kids at a lemonade stand to hand over their earnings, just because you, as the adult, have more power in the situation, you're probably a decent human being. A decent human being who wants to contribute to free educational resources instead of contributing to colleges. In which case, I hope that you make YouTube tutorials or free open source textbooks and class lectures. Those sort of contributions break the hegemony of the reverse lemonade stand. They actually give the kids at the lemonade stand an infusion of capital, showing them that entrepreneurialship is actually rewarding and that adults are trustworthy. This sort of educational exploitation found at colleges, which in turn confuses kids so much that they become socialists and anti-capitalists in droves when they realize their education is basically a company store/reverse lemonade stand. Adults need to be independent and find a career to make their income. Once they become financially independent they can be frugal and create free open source educational content. What we don't need is a class of "educational content creators" that aren't funded by their own savings, but by the loans, debts, and high tuition costs foisted upon 18 year olds.

To reiterate, the company-store fallacy is this: That you need to spend more money on education so that you can get a prestigious education which will allow you to be an educator who charges students more money in order to make the education appear more prestigious. That's just a vicious circle with a lot of people not at the top getting hurt. This fallacy is also what organizes the reverse lemonade stand, in which kids are funding the careers of adults instead of the inverse. All this needs to go away, and the best solution, in my opinion, is to teach kids how to program for free using OER and OCW. Giving kids a four year postsecondary education in computer science for free, even if you don't earn a degree, is valuable when combined with the opportunity tuition reimbursement at your first programming job affords. Then you can earn a degree from UoPeople and OMSCS for free when you're 22-26 years old. Philanthropic degrees are awesome, and I think it is risky to ignore them in this day and age when company stores are so prolific. They exist in nearly every town. How we ever organized education so that children are funding the careers of adults, instead of the other way around, is something that befuddles and frustrates me. If you don't see college for what it is, as a reverse lemonade stand, you'll be the one whose quarters are dimes earned selling lemonade are transferred to the coifers of eager adults. An educator who requires a tuition is not an educator but a company scrip in my opinion. Education should be free, and thanks to OER and OCW it is. To choose the alternative leaves you with debt that costs you millions of dollars over your lifetime. Fund your own career, not the career of someone you don't even know and doesn't live in your neighborhood.

## #12 - Colleges are just Hedge Funds

There is a saying that Harvard is a hedge fund with a school attached to it. That's pretty much the case with every school except community colleges. Colleges exist to feed into their endowment, which functions like a hedge fund. The more money colleges charge student, the more they can pump money into their hedge fund. Rather than buying an education, students are supplementing the administration's hedge fund. Unfortunately, there is no sharing of the endowment. Students, being "investors" in the hedge fund in that their money goes into investment vehicles, do not benefit from these investment. Students exchange their money, which goes into a hedge fund for benefit in perpetuity to the college administration, in exchange for a one-time certificate called a college degree. Whereas you would think since they were investing in a hedge fund, they would get a cut of the endowment in perpetuity, this in fact does not occur. The only people that benefit from the college's endowment hedge fund is the administration. Students are left cold with zero future earnings. Just a certificate, a piece of paper.

This seems a bit unfair, and honestly, it proably is. Because most 18 year olds don't have access to a hedge fund, I think they should do the next best thing: Earn $6000 in salary working a part time job each year while they are studying, and put that $6000 into a maxed-out Roth IRA at Vanguard each year buying VFIAX (S&P500) or VTSAX (Total Stock Market Index). Since this is a benefit of the American tax system, to 18 year olds without access to a hedge fund, this is probably the second best way students can profit from the stock market. Maxing out a $6000 Roth IRA when you're 18 is very doable, since working summers can earn something around $4000 and then you just need to earn that extra $2000 over the course of your two school semesters. If you're studying at UoPeople doing a [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html), you just need to tack on a extra $1300 to cover educational costs. That's $7300 a year, which is doable with working summers full-time and then part-time during the school semesters. By maxing out your Roth IRA while a college student at age 18-22, you are ensuring around $30k in your Roth IRA when you graduate from college at age 22. That $30k will compound tax-free for 38 years until you retire at 60 at an average rate of 10%, which will result in $1.1 million at age 60. That is, by working summers and part-time just a few hours a week to cover the cost of your F-You Degree, and enough to cover a max-out Roth IRA for that year, you could earn a million dollars for yourself while in school. That's why you should focus on putting money into YOUR hedge fund when you're 18-22 instead of putting money into someone ELSE'S hedgefund at 18-22. The person who earns the $1.1 million is either going to be you or someone else. Hopefully you'd prefer it to be you, and it's very possible by working summers and maxing out your Roth IRA while in college.

How can you put the money into your Roth instead of paying it towards college? Easy, do an F-You Degree, earn a scholarship to your hometown public university, or else Holm School for free, all while living at home. You'll be able to put your frugality towards your Roth, where it will compound 54-88 times what it's worth until your retirement depending on whether you're a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior. The long you put off maxing out your Roth/tIRA, and your 401k, especially due to student debt, the more your "gains" from investing while young dwindles. For example, whereas at 18 your Roth compounds 88x its amount, by 34 the earnings dwindle to roughly 12x. That's why it's foolish to put off index investing while young, especially forcibly such as when you have to pay off student loans. The hedge fund that profits in that case is the Univeristy's hedge fund, and sure as heck not you.

I think you should declare yourself a Satellite of Holm School and make your own Holm School endowment. "Fork" Holm School and make up a nonprofit called "*Your Last Name* School" and set up an endowment: Set up a Roth IRA at Vanguard as soon as you turn 18. This endowment is your Holm School hedge fund, and if you max it out starting at the age of 18 then you are basically buying your retirement at earnings 80-50 times the yearly additions while you're 18-22. If you continue Holm Schooling even after getting your first job, by using tuition reimbursement benefits to earn your advanced degrees affordably online such as through OMSCS, you'll pay nothing for the benefit and still Holm School and continue learning as a computer scientist. Match this by maxing out your 401k in an S&P500 fund from age 22 on at your first job with benefits, and you could be looking at an early retirement. The point is that you need to make sure your schooling choices are benefitting your forked Holm School and not some other school's hedge fund. You should set up your Holm School fork's hedge fund and do all that you can to make your retirement successful, rather than making someone else's retirement successful. Colleges have been taking advantage of students for decades, and their hedge fund "endowments" attached to the school have kept the salaries of administration flush for decades on student's fear of not earning a degree. Now, with the ubiquity of OER/OCW, employers are wising up to students not depending on college for knowledge, since adequate online learning platforms enable undergraduate-level learning for people at zero cost. This is the future, the future is not $1.5 trillion of student debt, and if you are a computer science students you turn your back to free OER at a possible immense personal cost, since getting a degree sucks around $1-2 million dollars from your retirement since an index fund equivalent investment to the value of your tuition is an opportunity cost of millions of dollars.

A college is a scam, basically. In exchange for putting your hard-earned money when you're just starting your careers into the university's endowment, you are granted a piece of paper. The endowment is a hedge fund, but you are not rewarded for investing in it. Instead, the college benefits 100% from the hedge fund in reward for handing out pieces of paper. You get paper money while the college gets the earnings from their hedge fund. If you were to establish your own fork of Holm School, completely doable since it's open source etc., you could set up an endowment to fund your self-university for the rest of your life. And, armed with the knowledge of the benefit of maxed-out Vanguard IRAs and 401ks invested in index funds when you're young, your fork of Holm School could be a hedge fund you 100% benefit from, instead of someone else benefitting. Your own fork of Holm School could endable you to retire early if you do max out your 401k starting at 22, by living frugally. This endowment could fund your own personal research for the rest of your life, instead of someone else's professorial job. You should be a professor at your fork of Holm School, not someone else. The professor benefitting from the university endowment should be you, not someone else. If you go to a university, it will be someone else benefitting from the professorial position enabled by your investment in the university hedge fund in exchange for a piece of paper. At your own fork of Holm School, the professorial salary can start getting paid in your mid thirties if you spend your twenties investing in the Holm School university endowment/hedge fund, which you 100% benefit from. There is no splitting of benefit, your own hedge fund is 100% your own personal profit. There is no hedge fund in the world that offers 100% benefit. That's the advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts that open up to you at age 18. It's a benefit in the tax code in order to persue people to save for retirement, and if you kick it up a level by starting your Holm School endowment, you can benefit so drastically investing in tax-advantaged accounts when young that you can even fund your own professorial position at your fork of Holm School starting in your thirties. This is early retirement, and it's simple math and compounding interest over decades. Set up your own hedge fund/endowment by forking your own Holm School.

When you go to college, another person's endowment gains the benefit of your investment. When you establish a *Your Last Name* School endowment, you're setting up a hedge fund that you 100% earn the profits from. Even a summer's wages of $3000 can be worth half a million dollars if invested in a Roth IRA for 38-42 years. By focusing your investment on your endowment, rather than college's endowment, you're setting up a hedge fund for yourself.

Colleges are just hedge funds with a school attached to them. Don't fall for the hype of certification and put your money in a hedge fun with a guarantee of 0% return. Invest in a hedge fund by opening up a Vanguard IRA and maxing it out while Holm Schooling and you'll have a million for retirement even before you start working and get a 401k, which you can then max out in your early twenties for millions upon millions of dollars.

Maxing out a Roth IRA while 18-22 by working summers ($4000) and a enough hours during the school year to pay for the rest of the $6000 IRA and a $1300 a year [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) means $7300 in earnings in a year. That's summer full-time and 12 hours a week while doing school. Doing that for four years while doing a F-You Degree will mean you graduate with a B.S. in CS from UoPeople with no debt and having maxed out your IRA for four years by age $22. As mentioned, that $30k (after compounding for four years) will result in $1.1 million by retirement at 60. 12 hours is a couple of hours a day, not including weekends. You will be able to study hard, pay your F-You Degree bill, and also earn enough to max out your IRA in a year. It's basically the same as setting up a hedge fund in your favor. That's why Holm Schools are public domain, and anyone can establish a Holm School endowment in their name. Do it, it'll be worth the hard work. Having a million saved up for retirement, even before you enter your working years, is a remarkable accomplishment. It's possible if you Holm School at live at home frugally, studying OER and OCW online and the resources at your public library and UoPeople.

Of course, then you can continue to fund your Holm School endowment by maxing out your 401k starting at your first job. Frugality and having a 401k "hedge fund" is like buying your freedom. Just a few years of maxing out your 401k in your early twenties will buy your retirement, and anything after that buys your early retirement. Don't turn down the advantages of having a hedge fund in your name, not somebody else's name. Since universities are hedge funds with schools attach, create your own university and get a hedge fund in your name. With tricks like ["A Simple Path to Wealth"](http://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series) one-stock portfolio, it's stupidly simple and just a matter of finding creative ways to be frugal while teaching yourself to program. A university, in my opinion, is not that path. Just a single intro to programming class at a university could fund 5+ years of PluralSight. Take the cheapest route and you'll buy your early retirement, or at least financial independence. Don't throw away possibly millions of dollars going into debt during the prime "savings years" when retirement returns exceed 30-80x the amount saved (using the rule of 72 and 11% interest (the average returns of a Vanguard S&P500 index fund) to calculate 2 to a certain power: 2^((60 - currentAge)/(72/11))). This factor dwindles quickly in your twenties down to a paltry 10x in your thirties, and down to zero by the time you're 60. Take Holm Schooling and frugal university as a full time job, when combined with IRAs and 401ks and index funds, and you'll basically buy your retirement with just a tiny amount of effort but extremely foresighted planning. Use the rule of 72 to your advantage when you're college age and the benefits of a Roth IRA are available at 18 years of age. A hedge fund could fuel your retirement, not a professor you don't even know's retirement, so create your own school and establish your own endowment.

If a college is "successful" enough that you want to go there, they probably have enough of an endowment that they're doing just fine without your going there. What college needs to be successful is your own lifelong learning college called *You Name* School. That's the university endowment that needs to be successful enough that people want to study there. Fork a Holm School, these blog posts are the blueprint for establishing a hedge fund endowment with just a few tens of thousands of dollars when you're university age. Those other colleges are already successful, make YOUR school successful and contribute to YOUR university endowment, not some other guy's. If you need advice on how to establish an "endowment" in your IRAs and 401ks, read ["A Simple Path to Wealth" by J.L. Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series). It's stupidly simple. I wish you the best of luck in establishing your own school. That's what I did at Holm School and I have absolutely no regrets pumping my money into my own endowment to fund my own scholasticism, instead of someone else's in exchange for a silly piece of paper. What I learn is forever mine to keep and exploit, I don't need a degree for validation after just a couple years of experience. And what I learned at Treehouse and through OER/OCW was enough to get me hired at my first job with 401ks and tuition reimbursement. I now will always have jobs with 401ks and tuition reimbursement, so I will always max out my 401k and IRA first before spending any money on myself and will always take advantage of getting free college classes and degrees with my tuition reimbursement. Holm Schooling worked in my case, and I'm willing to bet it will work in your case too. With college so affordable thanks to UoPeople, and programming tutorials so affordable thanks to Treehouse, Lynda, Safari Books, and PluralSight (many of which public libraries pay for in cities), you'll find that your education budget meets all your professional and professorial needs for just a couple hundreds of dollars a year. That's why thanks to open source educational resources you can hopefully even retire early as a computer scientist, so that you can focus on open source or computer science scholasticism. Good luck!

## #11 - Programming Jobs Pay Tuition Reimbursement as a Benefit, and Online College Can be Cheap

One of the greatest advantages of choosing computer science as a career is that, usually, programming jobs have great benefits. Part of that benefit is usually a 401k, which by living frugally you can max out ($19,000 currently) in a S&P500 fund every year, along with your Vanguard IRA ($6000 currently) on the side. Then, when you leave the job, you can roll your 401k over into your Vanguard IRA, where you'll probably get a better expense ratio (the S&P500 fund in my TIAA 403b at my first job was 0.3% E/R, so I rolled it over into my Vanguard IRA as VTSAX at a 0.04% E/R).

Another benefit is that most programming jobs offer some form of tuition reimbursement. This is sort of an awkward benefit, don't you need a degree to get hired? But what's the point of tuition reimbursement if you already have a degree? Are you supposed to get two degrees from tuition reimbursement? Do you have enough time to get a Bachelor's or Master's degree while working? Should you spend a lot of money on an online degree in hopes of advancing in your career?

But in recent years those questions have been answered due to some important philanthropic projects. The first is University of the People, which offers $4000 bachelor's of science in computer science. It is affordable because it is online, there is no physical campus, and it uses only free OER in its curriculum. It's kind of like Holm School, except you actually get a degree at the end. However, it is not free. My expectation is that in the future, public libraries will pay for UoPeople degrees, but until that day arrives you're on the hook for the $1000 a year. You can either do it two ways: work roughly 3 hours a week (at minimum wage) while you're at UoPeople to cover tuition so that you graduate debt-free, or else find a way to borrow the $1000 a year. With an [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html), you could come out with a debt free education and the skills necessary to get hired. That relies on paying for Treehouse and UoPeople, but the time sacrifice is relatively small compared to what a brick and mortar college costs. Find a way to graduate debt free. Even better is if you work more to max out your Roth IRA while a computer science student for four years. That could be worth a million at retirement.

Of course, you could completely Holm School and pay nothing for the luxury of learning computer science. That is what OER and OCW grant a CS student, and even your public library's Lynda account can augment your skill tree. With four years of intensive Holm Schooling, you could possibly even build enough of a Github "resume" of contributions so that you can get your first junior developer's job spending zero money. It's a risk, one that is becoming increasingly a better bet since there are so many computer science jobs at the moment, but otherwise you're on the hook of working 3-4 hours a week while studying to pay for your F-You Degree.

Of course, if you manage to get hired after Holm Schooling and spending $0 on education, you're now in a job that will pay for your college degree. That's the point in which you can go ahead and earn those accreditations, when you're working at age 22. UoPeople will still be $1000 a year, but the difference is your employer will be paying for it. I was hired at my first job without a CS degree. As a benefit I got 80% off my educational costs. I could have essentially finished my CS degree at UoPeople for $200 a year. At my most recent job, I get a $3000 a year stipend on accredited educational costs. UoPeople falls well within this maximum stipend. I could essentially get a CS degree for free.

That's where it should be said, on top of tuition reimbursement, you also sometimes get an educational stipend at a job. My previous employer paid for a Lynda account for employees (which I already had through my public library). My current employer pays for my year PluralSight cost ($200). Both of these companies are unaccredited for-profits, so they technically aren't tuition reimbursement, however you do get educational stipends sometimes at jobs. Getting tuition reimbursement on top of a PluralSight account is like a lifetime of free learning. UoPeople will always be within the value of my tuition reimbursement: After I get a CS degree, I could take their business classes, get an MBA from them, or even get a M.Ed from UoPeople. I have like four possible degrees I could get from UoPeople for free over the next few decades. That's not even including the free PluralSight, Lynda, and Treehouse accounts I have through my job and public library. I have literally decades of free learning and degrees. And even more affordable online philanthropic universities will get made in the oncoming decades thanks to widespread adoption and creation of OER. UoPeople or someone else will continue to offer affordable online degrees, to the point that it's free to take through your public library's endowment. That's my prediction.

Then there's the next level of philanthropic accredited degrees: GaTech's OMSCS degree. It's a $8000 Master's of computer science. At $8000 total, it too falls within the budget constraints of my tuition reimbursement. So I could, rather than studying at UoPeople, get a free Master's degree. Again, because UoPeople and OMSCS are so affordable, they are completely covered through tuition reimbursement. Now that I'm working, I can _get paid_ at a job, earning valuable years of experience, instead of paying tuition at a college and earning nothing in salary except a degree. Through tuition reimbursement I can still earn my degrees part time in my nonworking hours at zero costs. That means, I could have a UoPeople BS in CS, a MS in CS OMSCS degree, and a PluralSight/Lynda/Treehouse/O'Reilly Online accounts for free. If this is the kind of luxuries programmers get at their job, spending a lot of money (which could go into index funds) just to learn computer science is an enormous waste of opportunity. Ride the affordable CS tidal wave -- maybe a $5200 F-You Degree if you don't like the risk of not getting a job without a degree -- and then free perpetual learning and degrees after that. OER will become a more and more common practice (not relegated just to the computer sciences), and more affordable online degree programs will be created. You will be able to study anything you want for any degree possible for free thanks to tuition reimbursement. Right now, you might as well focus on CS/Business through UoPeople and OMSCS. Those are the most relevant degrees for you. But in the future, the world of education will open up for employed computer scientists. After all, you can now practically Holm School any subject for free thanks to OER/OCW. Soon, you'll earn degrees too. Are degrees even necessary? That'll be for you to decide. But economics won't weight into the decision: it will all be within the usual monetary restrictions on tuition reimbursement.

It might be a wise decision to get a UoPeople degree and study at Treehouse for four years to get a junior dev job, then get an OMSCS degree for free with your tuition reimbursement. If you don't even want to go $5200 in debt, you could Holm School and try to get a junior dev position spending nothing on education. The gamble is yours, but know that keeping your educational costs low when you're young and remaining frugal when employed at 22+ enables the maxing out of IRA and 401ks which buys you your economic freedom. You can worry about degrees while you're employed in a job that permits you to not only max out your tax-advantaged accounts each year, but also study at UoPeople and OMSCS for free. You can come out with hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax-advantaged accounts and a BS and MS degree in computer science at around 28 years of age. You can jump into an even better job, get a raise with your new MS degree, or continue to take maximum advantage of frugality and maximized tax-advantaged accounts until you're in your mid-thirties, when you can gain financial independence and possibly retire.

Not spending a lot of money on education is a very important tactic in earning financial independence at a young age. With affordable CS degrees, this means you can graduate debt free by working a few hours a week while studying, or you can earn your degrees after hired in a junior dev position for free through tuition reimbursement. Massive amounts of free education are available in most programming jobs. UoPeople is so affordable that most tuition reimbursement plans 100% cover it. PluralSight is so affordable most employers will pay for their employee's account. Public libraries subscribe to computer science education services. Paying thousands of dollars for a single university class just isn't a wise decision in this day and age of ubiquitous affordable online education. Not to mention ubiquitous CS OER and OCW. The "student debt crisis" has been solved, in my opinion. The question is, will you be the one to take advantage of the actual solutions that are in place? Or will you continue to seek extra advantage over the competition by seeking out a prestigious degree for additional dollars? Prestige, however, is a bubble, and you're going to be left with debt instead of a swelling 401k and IRA account. What's important is gaining financial independence, not earning prestigious degrees. Maximize your frugality as much as you can when you're young, and you'll find yourself at age 28 with the same level of degree as your peers, but with enough savings in tax-advantaged accounts that you're almost guaranteed to have millions of dollars at retirement. Prestigious degrees might seem cool to impressionable young kids, but if they knew they were throwing away millions of dollars in pursuit of them, they would probably spend more time studying the world of OER and OCW and making free self-education plans for themselves through their newfound OER literacy.

Computer science is a great career. You can fund your retirement at the same time you're funding your education. The advantages of studying CS are almost unfair if you don't realize the difference between CS and other fields. There are so many opportunities for beginning computer scientists that only cost a couple of hundred of dollars a year. To enroll in university, without your employer covering the cost, is such a risky gamble given what it prevents you from doing: investing in index funds in tax-advantaged accounts starting at age 22, where it's return is something around 50x the saved value. At 22, a $25,000 savings in a maxed-out IRA and 401k is worth around $1.25 million at retirement at 60. Earning $1.25 million dollars a year by being frugal is a great hobby to have, I doubt anyone could suggest better or more realistic ways to earn $1.25 million at just age 22. It's worth finding a way to make it happen. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley tycoon to have a prosperous retirement: sometimes it's as simple as finding a means to be frugal in your twenties. I doubt anyone would think a more prestigious degree is worth $1.25 million a year. No degree is worth that much. If you can graduate debt-free, and I think that's possible through UoPeople and Treehouse and a small part-time job, you can build for yourself a generous retirement. Holm School's goal is to teach your how to keep educational costs as low as possible when you're young. Knowing that most programming jobs come with tuition reimbursement should help you strategize what you're going to do in regards to degrees: earn them before or after finding employment as a junior developer? Only you can choose for yourself. But know that you don't have to spend a lot of money either way. And spending as little as possible opens doors.

Chances are, your first programming job will pay tuition reimbursement as a benefit. Be sure not to put the cart before the horse by spending money on a CS degree in which your employer will gladly pay. With UoPeople and OMSCS, you can earn up to a master's degree at possibly zero cost to you. Strategize accordingly.

## #10 - Education has been Solved by Crowdsourcing

I am currently just a month away from qualifying for tuition reimbursement at my job. My manager has already approved my plans for using that reimbursement (even including the possibility of driving to the local public university (10 minutes away from work) during the day to attend one class a semester and clocking it as my lunch break and just working overtime to make up the difference -- how amazing!).

But what I was thinking about was YouTube. I am sitting watching a video about passive versus active management and I thought about how there was hardly any need to even enroll in university, even if those classes are free for me thanks to tuition reimbursement. The [entire curriculum at UoPeople is available online](https://my.uopeople.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=45606) for self-study for free since it uses 100% OER. The GaTech OMSCS degree is also free online for self-study through Udacity's video hosting. Not only can I take the same classes, but I can do so free. To get a degree seems like a detriment to me professionally, rather than a boon. Do I even want to take advantage of my tuition reimbursemen when it mandates that I enroll at an accredited university, when YouTube is just sitting there?

It almost makes me a little scared. I mean, thanks to the effort of a few nonprofits, a bachelor's and a master's degree-worth of education is just sitting for free on the internet. Understandably, the only affordable online colleges are UoPeople and OMSCS for computer science, so those are the classes I would enroll in. Why even enroll if I don't benefit in any way from taking the classes through self-study, other than getting a degree? I'm very close to deciding tuition reimbursement would be a detriment to my career, rather than a boon. I'm turning down a master's degree in computer science.

It really seems like it's just too much overhead. I have to worry about taking a proctored exam, I have to worry about making comments on an LMS, I have to worry about taking too hard or too soft of a class load given that I work. Why not just do it on my own for free and pace it according to my own schedule, instead of a syllabus' schedule? It seems the advantage of pacing it according to my own life is infinitely better than worry about a class schedule that bites into my freedoms afforde by my job.

And that's when I realized, education has been solved by crowdsourcing. Whereas school has traditionally had no means of crowdsourcing -- the library's stack was basically the extent of peer to peer sharing -- now a days almost all current educational practices are crowd sourced on the internet. There are hundreds of companies attempting to create open source educational content. Once that content is open sourced, it is in the public domain forever. There is literally no way colleges can compete with the public domain, since the economics of paying for a service you could get for free via the public domain becomes a bizarre question of fashion. And fashion is fickle -- while it could be cool to go to college today, in ten years going to college might be seen as gauche. That's because college, in its current form, is never free. Education, however, is free in non-college forms. That's because internet hosting, web servers, and open education have contributed software and content into the public domain for free. At the point in which computer science can 100% be learned for free online through a computer, "education," and all the sticky mess that comes from tuition and dorm costs which at this point are bloated beyond recompense, have entirely been mitigated. There is zero need to pay tuition or for dorms. There is zero need to pay for textbooks. There is a solution: and it's that computer science can be learned entirely free online through OER/OCW and your public library. And if you want more than that, rather than costing thousands of dollars a semester, a PluralSight account costs just $200 a year.

That is solvency. That is a group of people seeing a problem -- the high cost of education in America -- and crowdsourced a free equivalency. The irony of crowdsourcing is that there is no single point of truth. There isn't _a_ free college, there isn't _a_ free curriculum, there isn't _a_ free computer science degree. Instead, the collective effort of many thousands of people have create an _equivalent_ to free college, an equivalent to a free curriculum, and equivalent to a free computer science degree. The irony is that this mode of creation and production is entirely opposite to the model of brick and mortar colleges. You don't take a class here and there from different colleges, you get ONE degree from ONE college. You don't study for a few months at college A, then study at college B for half a year, then study at college C for a few weeks. You are locked in to just one source of knowledge. That's reprehensible given what's possible with the internet and open source. It's the same sort of thing you see in "Walled Garden" approaches to software that lock you into a proprietary operating system and ecosystem. Walled Gardens are created to keep you stupid -- keep you away from the competition and free alternatives and forever sucking the teet of system providers, who earns billions from being closed-source.

Crowd sourcing on the other hand recognizes that there is no reason to have a single point of truth. Learn from this professor for a few months, learn from this professor at another school for a few months, jump over to this college's OCW for half a year. Having dilineated "teams" is a waste of effort. Through crowdsourcing, each point of truth can make a small contribution for very little upfront investment, and the accumulated whole of the effort, through all these disparate entities, creates a non-proprietary point of truth. The problem is employers don't understand this, they'll never understand a resume that lists the thirty or so OpenCourseWare classes you took online in your quest to become a computer scientist for free. Some do, however, and you should seek these employers out for your first job.

Education has been solved through crowdsourcing. The problem is, HR departments have not. But if HR departments are not hip to the fact that future generations of students will never again pay for tuition in order to get a degree from a single source of truth when there is a crowdsourced solution, they will lose the war for talent. There is no talent in paying for a degree simply to get hired. There is talent in researching tax-advantaged investing accounts to such a degree that you are aware of the benefit of saving when young, including on educational costs. A knowledge that educational costs have been solved through crowdsourced open education. That's the sort of talent that business should hire for: zero debt candidates. Candidates who are looking to retire in 10 years of employment. When a company starts generating hundreds of early retirees at age 35, that's going to be a place that students want to get hired and work. In a world where HR departments are adding Vanguard index funds to their 401ks, it's silly to ignore the equivalent of Vanguard in education: open education. Open education and index funds make sense. Learning about and using both is a direct equivalency of talent. As index fund investing grows in popularity, so too we'll see the popularity of open education. Both deal with finances, and both translate into increased savings. That's why Holm School teaches financial independence along with computer science. Because open education is the index funds of college. Colleges are active traders, resulting in lower returns versus passive open education.

As John Bogle describes in his books, when Vanguard first created index funds, they were smeered as Unamerican. The same is also true of open source. The same is also true of open education. We're not yet over the hump where people are fully cognizant of the opporunities afforded by open education computer science curriculum, but soon this will become default. It is inevitable, and to decide otherwise is a matter of fashion rather than mathematics. College costs are unsustainable, they have already devastated my generation. The next generation won't use a single college, they'll use hundreds of colleges that created OER for free when they learn computer science. It's as inevitable as the success of index funds, of open source. OER is legit and not going anywhere. Soon there will be an affordable Spotify for Books for $15 a month. Education is exploding right now, and the previous problem of exploding student debt is completely avoidable through computer science open education. To think that students need to adapt, and choose a costly college, is ridiculous. HR departments need to adapt and choose financially solvent but equally talented hirees.

I'm not proposing that there be a stigma against student debtors in hiring practices. But given that the general perception is that people without college degrees won't get hired anywhere, it's necessary to see that this particular problem will be solved by some more transparent applications, perhaps ones that exceed a single page, listed off completed OER/OCW along with open source projects on github. Why this seems any less legitimate than hiring based on college completion is something I don't understand, and imagine will fall by the wayside in future generations. If you are a legitimate programmer, you will get hired somewhere. You can then use tuition reimbursement to complete your degrees. There is no need to spend any money on computer science education given the robustness of the open education public domain.

Most people still mope around because of high education costs. Some people don't study what they want to study because they can't afford college, and think their efforts will be in vain if they don't wind up with a degree. The true test is whether your skills that you learn online are useful to an employer, not that you have completed a degree. Degrees are the lazy way to decide that, outsourcing the work to a paid professor. As resumes move to Github instead of LinkedIn or whatever, people will understand that the next generation of programmers don't have college degrees and won't be reliant on a college's prestige to score employment. Programming isn't kids stuff, and computer science education won't be relegated to the playground that passes for college these days, in which who-can-pay-for-the-most-expensive-clothes is the arbiter of playground supremacy, rather than sound judgment and forethought.

It's a meritocracy, baby. Get in on the ground floor and teach yourself about Open Education, Financial Independence, Index Funds, and Computer Science. The sky's your limit, no joke. Anyone willing to teach themselves computer science for free will find that the difficulties are small and rewards are immense. Let's thank the open educators, OER writers, public libraries, OCW professors, and internet hosting providers that make the future so bright, instead of the dismay and destruction that affected my generation when they graduated with high student loans into a Great Recession. Educational costs have been solved by crowdsourcing. To rely on Walled Garden ecosystems is self-imprisonment, and one that will cost you in freedom and wealth. Anyone who complains about the walled garden of college costs can be better responded to with information about computer science OER.

## #9 - You Should Focus on your IRA not your Degree

College takes you away from the possibility of maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA at the very moment you should be focusing doing just that. To make it worse, instead of not maxing out your IRA, you're actually taking on debt if you go to college, which makes the time that you start maxing out your IRA even more delayed. It's a lose-lose situation.

Here's my hot take: You should work a part-time job for enough hours that you earn $7300 a year starting at age 18. That $7300 would cover: 1 year of tuition at University of the People studying Computer Science B.S. ($1000). 1 year of Treehouse ($300). And a maxed out Roth IRA ($6000). That $7300 a year for four years is enough to fuel half a retirement. Let's look at the math:

Maxing out your Roth IRA at current IRA maximums would be $6000 a year from age 18-22. With a 10% return, you would have $27,800 in your Roth IRA at age 22. You would also have taught yourself how to program using Holm School, Treehouse, Lynda from your public library, freeCodeCamp, [all the other free coding resources](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-03-Computer-Science-Curriculum.html#further-studies), as well as earning a B.S. in CS from UoPeople. You can start working in a programming job in your home town, living at home for the first few years. That $27,800 in your Roth IRA at 22 would compound to $1.04 million dollars (at 10%) by the time you're 60 (38 years). $1 million won't be the same in 40 years as it is now, but it's still a nice upstart.

Because you Holm Schooled and got your first programming job with a college degree you paid off working part time, you'll be debt free with a programming degree in your home town. By living at home for a few more years, you can max out your traditonal or Roth IRA ($6000) as well as your 401k (buying a S&P500 fund) for $19,000 a year, since you'll be living at home. Your job might pay tuition reimbursement, which means while you're still living at home you can continue to study computer science and earn a Master's in CS for just $8000 from Georgia Tech OMSCS. That $8000 over 3-5 years is well within most yearly tuition reimbursement budgets. At the point in which you complete your Masters in CS, you'll have maxed out your 401k and IRA from ages 22-27, resulting in $197,473.76 in tax advantaged accounts (your initial $27.8k when college age plus $25,000 a year for five years, plus 10% interest). That will be worth $4.59 million dollars at age 60.

Then, at age 27, you'll be able to move into a house if you don't want to keep living at home. Move into an affordable house, or rent, and you'll have a small mortgage. By keeping frugal, you'll be able to keep maxing out your IRA and 401k as well as saving in a post-tax brokerage account. With a master's degree in CS, you'll find a higher paying job in your hometown. You already have enough to retire on at age 27, so you can pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible while still maxing out your 401k and IRA. By age 35, you'll have $805k in tax-advantaged accounts, be close to paying off your affordable mortgage, and your cost of living will be so low due to your frugality that you'll be able to retire. You can use a Roth IRA ladder to access your retirement savings early. Or else keep working at that $805k will be worth $8.7 million at retirement. You can basically become a philanthropist.

Most kids think college is their opportunity to make more money in life. In fact, it's just the opposite. If you are going into debt at age 18, you are squandering away the potential to fund your retirement just from maxing out a Roth IRA from age 18-22. Maybe even a summer job would be enough to max out your Roth IRA, not even working during the school year. By funding a [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) by working part time and then working the extra hours to be able to max out your Roth IRA, you could basically save enough to be a millionnaire at retirement. And that's even before your career starts. You'll want to max out your 401k and IRA in your twenties and have a savings rate as high as you can (at least 50%) while in your twenties. That is very difficult if you have college debt.

Since you can teach yourself computer science free online, there is no need to spend money on college. You can spend four years from age 18-22 Holm Schooling on all the free online resources to learn computer science. Live at home and work just enough hours to pay for your F-You Degree and your maxing out of your Roth IRA, whatever the IRA limit is at that time. Once you do those two tasks, stop working part time and study computer science. You might not even have to work during the school year if you work full time during the summer. Try and find an internship so you're getting paid while also gaining programming experience which you can use to get a job once you get your UoPeople degree. Once you get a programming job with a 401k and tuition reimbursement, you can then spend the next block of your life maxing out your tax advantaged accounts, getting a masters degree while living at home, and saving as much as possible.

That's how you Holm School. You don't Holm School by going to college. College is nice if you can go free, otherwise it sucks up all potential you have to fund your retirement while you're in your teens and twenties, when investing in index funds gives the most return on investment.

People say college gives you a million dollars in earning extra over a lifetime. Just spending some time at a compound calculator actually shows that losing out on maxing out your Roth IRA from age 18-22 removes $1 million from your retirement. So it's a moot point. You might as well get on the path to early retirement and Holm School a UoPeople CS degree while working part time for enough hours to fund UoPeople and your Roth. You'll wind up with a degree and zero debt, and enough in a Roth to compound to $1 million by the time you retire. That's even before you get your first programming job. After that, it's all about remaining frugal in your twenties, when savings invested in index funds in IRAs, 401ks, and post-tax brokerage accounts return [something like 30-50x the savings amount](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-09-Ending-Thoughts.html#the-secrets-of-compounding-interest-from-a-programmers-perspective) by the time you retire.

Your job isn't to go to college. Your job is to find out how to get your first programming job for as little money spent as possible. Since that's your goal, college is obviously out of the runnings because it is so expensive. Holm Schooling, or a F-You Degree, is so affordable its free (in the case of Holm Schooling) or so inexpensive you can pay for it working 3 hours a week (in the case of a F-You Degree). If you live at home for the first few years after you get your first programming job, you can have a high savings rate (my savings rate is 80% living at home) which you can put towards your retirement. With that high of a savings rate, even while earning a master's degree in CS from GATech OMSCS, you'll basically be buying your early retirement. Otherwise you can keep working even through your forties and earn enough so that you can be a philanthropist. By being frugal, even in regards to education, you are becoming rich.

College is not worth the set back it creates in your retirement. Holm School and get your first programming job debt-free. You can use tuition reimbursement to earn any degrees you missed from UoPeople and GATech. You can live at home while earning these free degrees, since you'll be studying full time basically, all while working a job and having a 80% savings rate. That's enough to retire early even before you strike off and leave home with a Master's degree in Computer Science.

Instead of retiring at 35, college forces you to work decades longer than you would need to if you Holm Schooled. That's the danger of debt at a young age. But you can reverse that and avoid college debt and instead benefit from compound interest at a young age. Doing that can establish a retirement fund even before you get your first programming job.

If you are confused about how to do this IRA business, please visit [Tips for Personal Finance](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-09-Ending-Thoughts.html#tips-for-personal-finance) or read [JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series) or visit our [free index fund resources Github repo](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-04-Free-Index-Funds-Books.html).

The important thing when you're 18 isn't your college degree, it's your Roth IRA. Set one up at Vanguard and put your energy into maxing that out to the limit when you're "college age" while also studying computer science on Holm School or similar sites and you'll find you're earned yourself $1 million at retirement in just four years of work. With your first programming job, you can buy your early retirement by maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (and then a post-tax one) while you're still frugally living at home or else affordably in a rental property with roommates in your home town.

A College education isn't got at college anymore. A college education is found online for free. Paying a college for the benefit of your college education is a great way to write yourself out of retirement. Instead of learning programming for free, you're requiring decades longer of work just for the comfort of actually having a degree at age 22. If you can get a job after Holm Schooling CS for four years, and then use tuition reimbursement to earn those degrees, you're basically buying your freedom. College steals your freedom. It is a scam, in my opinion. The amount of money I spent on getting an art history degree would have been worth $6.0 million when I was 65 if I had invested that amount at age 22 instead. I went to a private college because I thought I was smart. Instead, going to a private college was literally the dumbest thing I have done in my entire life (other than a few horrible relationship decisions). My art history degree is literally worthless. The cost of going to college will forever impair my net worth. If I hadn't studied computer science when I was 29, I never would have a job that pays more than minimum wage. Going to college to study computer science is the only rational choice for people nowadays, but at the same time since there are so many free open source resources to learn CS online, there's no reason to pay anyone more than a couple hundred of bucks a year to learn to program. You can Holm School completely free using Open Educational Resources. You can learn CS through your public library's digital and physical resources. It's a great time to be a college age student, because if you want to be a programmer you can basically work for a decade and a half and if you're frugal, retire early. Since learning programming is free, you don't have to worry about college debt and you can focus on your 401k and IRA.

Part of Holm School is teaching that college has been deprecated. It's a sour product that has exceeded its "Best By" date. College actually prevents your from achieving your goals, versus working hard through self-study/holm schooling for free online. If you really need a degree, go with UoPeople. But otherwise almost everything you need to get your first job is available free at your public library or online. That's the amazing thing about open source. It can make you a philanthropist, able to be financially independent by age 35, at which point you can use your future earnings to whatever end you want. Be a philanthropist. Contribute to open source education, so that everyone else in the future can avoid college debt, not just the computer scientists. Let's move on past this deplorable period in history where "non-profits" are exploiting kids for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## #8 - You Can Rely on Volunteer Material to Learn Computer Science

Colleges have a lot of things going on for them. It's hard to argue with a huge ass building, for example. If you're studying in a huge ass expensive building, you're going to believe you need to pay a high tuition price for that privilege.

But let's suss this out. Do you need anything you don't already have to study in your room at home? Umm, maybe a new desk? Or chair? Maybe a new monitor? In terms of material cost, a new (cough cough used on Craigslist) desk or monitor is chump change compared to building and maintaining a huge ass building. So if you're a student at a college, you'll buy into the belief you need to pay thousands of dollars to study books. But if you're a student in your bedroom, you'll be much more discriminating about expenditures. When you already have what you need, there is neglible investments needed. And absolutely zero tuition.

In much the same way, open source educational resources have a lot less infrastructure necessary. Rather than needing a printing press with distribution supply chains and university book stores to distribute the material, all OER needs is a web host (free for example through github pages or netlify). Since OER is read on a "BYOD" ("bring your own device") ebook reader, the author assumes no production cost. Anyone can open source a textbook they just wrote and put it on the internet for free. Maybe they might buy a domain? (but again, Github is always free). Without the "huge ass building" of the traditional textbook distribution model, OER is the equivalent of studying in your bedroom. It demands very little because there is no infrastructure involved. And since computer scientists already know how to code up web pages, they don't need to learn anything new to create a site to host the textbook. In a sense, there is no "tuition" involved in an author open sourcing a textbook. Because there is no huge ass building, unlike traditional textbooks. So there is little justification for charging anything for its consumption and use.

Now comes the interesting part. Since studying computer science in your bedroom costs so very little money but has great results thanks to OER and OCW being produced by volunteer educators, there is a feedback loop where people without money come to rely on volunteers, and volunteers keep producing OER because they make so much money with the knowledge they have that they are imparting through OER. This in turn allows people to begin careers that eventually enable them to make so much money that they can, a few years down the road, create OER (or other open source projects). Because linux created so many jobs, for example, many people today contribute to open source. Since so many people contribute to open source, the open source textbook ecosystem in computer science (and slowly other subjects) is so robust that you can teach yourself linux and open source software for free. Like moving down a pyramid, more and more people are going to start contributing to open source through what they learn from open source. That's because volunteering engenders more volunteering. And when volunteer effort is successful and changes/improves lives, then the people whose lives have improved through volunteering will volunteer as soon as they become successful enough to spare volunteer hours. Since writing a book isn't particularly difficult, more and more open source textbooks will be written. That's incredible to think about, because open source textbooks already bring up the issue of D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) in that as soon as you have one open source textbook, there is decreasing need for two open source textbooks. Everyone can just focus their contributions on the one textbook. That's what negating copyright permits. In a sense, you really only need about thirty good open source computer science textbooks to teach an undergraduate curriculum. In my opinion, we are there, and that's why I created Holm School.

Though universities are nonprofit, their output is not an act of volunteering. That's fine, let there be the opportunity for education that doesn't rely solely on volunteer effort. But if you are willing to rely on volunteer effort, you can teach yourself computer science for free. That might be hard to will yourself to believe with all the advertising and journals, etc., that say you need a university with a lot of monetary resources in order to get a good education. But that's not true, it's just marketing. You can totally give yourself a good education relying on volunteer effort. Look how UoPeople uses volunteer professors, and in that way offer a $4000 bachelors degree in computer science. People are willing to volunteer to help people succeed in computer science. That's why UoPeople uses OER. It relies on the volutneer effort of its volunteer professorial body as well as the volunteer effort of OER textbook authors to proffer a college degree that you can pay for [working 3 hours a week in a minimum wage job](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html). They don't have a huge ass building they need to pay for, everything is done online using open source EdTech. So no one is fooled into paying high tuition, instead they pay tuition that can be earned working a few hours a week or a month during the summer. That's why UoPeople demonstrates the future potential of open source education: volunteers get shit done.

It's pretty easy in this cynical world to think volunteers are wretched people. Okay, this might be far fetched, but people actually look down at people to whom volunteer their time to help other people. I was watching a PluralSight course today and the author, upon discussing open source "movement" (I hate when people say "the open source movement"), said, "Marx would be proud!" sarcastically. Umm, what? More shit from Microsoft developers that open source is communist? I thought that crap when out the window a decade ago. Yet here it is, from a PluralSight author's new course (the same course where he said anyone pirating PluralSight videos "should be ashamed of themselves" lol). People don't understand that open source is good capitalism because it is good engineering. You can build reliable software using volunteer's time. Do you go up to people volunteering in a food bank and sneer, "Marx would be so proud of you!" What a douche thing to do! Yet here is some developer saying the same of people who volunteer their time towards creating free software. Not everyone has the same concept of what volunteer work is deemed "capitalistic" versus "communistic" (are we still talking about this???). Some people feel like their volunteer effort is more valuable put towards the skills they have in software. Rather than volunteering in a soup kitchen, they volunteer on github. Who am I to sneer at them and call them communists? I'm sorry a Microsoft drone got triggered by Github (which.. is... owned... by... Microsoft...). But we're not communists and we don't produce open source because we're all Marxists. We do that because we want to improve the world and that's how we deem our volunteer efforts most productive for the spare time we have. Many people volunteer in many ways. Not everyone has to do the same thing. Some people can create software and packages without copyright. Some people can write textbooks and books without copyright. Just because people don't usually think of that as "volunteering" means that it's useless or, in this PluralSight author's case, a communist conspiracy.

Sometimes a lot of effort is put into making people believe they can't rely on volunteers. Some "sacred" things, like education, are too important to be risked by putting them into the hands of volunteers. But that's bullshit in the day and age of the internet. Once someone teaches something well online and with an open source license, it's there _forever_ for anyone to reuse or modify for adjustments for the future. Anyone can "fork" it and make a derivative work when the original author decides to no longer maintain it. There's no hassle of getting permissions to adapt the work because the license is open source. Forking it can happen at any time or place. Volunteers can build upon other volunteer's effort, and compound their effort without repeating themselves, duplicating work, or market competition. That's why volunteer works in the public domain don't require the infrastructure of universities, because they are small and adaptable and cheap. Without the legal constructs of enterprise works, open source doesn't require constant maintenance and paid development. It can exist without charging fees, relying entirely on volunteer effort (because at any time, anyone can fork it). Fees are nonexistent, or abstracted away through minimal advertising.

Volunteers are good people. They are not marxists. They don't have it in for you. They aren't trying to overthrow the government or upper classes. Oh my god, I can't believe I have to write this in 2020 about open source. But this PluralSight course makes me sad that people are still so afraid of open source. Volunteers make the world a better place, whether they are food bank employees or github contributers. Volunteer textbook authors who open source their computer science textbooks enable you to learn to program, or even advanced topics in computer science, for free. UoPeople and OMSCS, for example, charge minimal costs for computer science degrees by their nature of being online. It's a wild world where you can get an [F-You Degree](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-01-The-F-You-Degree.html) and a Masters in computer science for $13,000 total. It's an even crazier world where you can teach yourself how to program enough to get a junior development job for free using OER and OCW so that you can use your tuition reimbursement benefit from your job to pay that $13,000 instead, meaning zero cost to you to get yourself a master's degree in computer science. To think of the possibilities for people needing to learn computer science for free, and to call the volunteer effort of many scientists something that "would make Marx proud" just shows how even good ideas get dragged through the mud. Intolerance isn't just a river in Africa.

Be proud enough to rely on volunteer efforts to improve your lives. You don't have to take everything offered every time, but you can use enough of it to keep your actual costs so low that you can turn your life around into one of prosperity instead of lack. To believe that you have to go into debt at a young age just to have a chance of earning a comfortable salary isn't true. You don't need a huge ass building to learn computer science. You can teach yourself in four years just in your bedroom. And using volunteer, free open source textbooks, you can do it without any debt. Who would go into debt just to read in your bedroom? No body. And so no body should go into debt to learn computer science either. All you need is a bedroom and a computer, which you already have (if not then go to a public library).

Enough disparaging of volunteers. Let's have people brave enough to recognize that they are actually making a contribution to society and changing lives. I know through the efforts of my public library I started a career as a programmer with no cost. I know because people donate to my city's public library they could afford to subscribe to Treehouse on my behalf. I know because people volunteer at the public library, they could keep costs low enough to spare the money to buy Treehouse for their patrons. The same is true for Lynda or Safari Books subscriptions at other libraries. I know people have donated small stipends to pay for textbooks to be written and made open source. I know people have taken their stipends from a university job and open sourced a book they wrote. Those university's endowments were donations. I know people donate to Khan Academy so that they can keep churning out educational videos. I know people volunteer closed captioning translations so that Khan Academy can have a global reach. I know volunteers write code that enable web sites to be created for free, so people can put their creative works online to be consumed for free at very little cost. People volunteer their time to make educational YouTube videos. To think all these people are naive (or Marxist) is to completely misread the room. In the world of abundance that is America, people are willing to volunteer their spare time and effort to making the world a better place (increasingly this means creating things online since the world is networked). That's American capitalism in action, not Soviet agents. Without the abundance that American capitalism engenders, there wouldn't be the spare time to make open source works. Not everyone has to be rich beyond measure. Some people can say when they've had ["enough"](https://archive.org/details/enoughtruemeasur00bogl) and refocus their efforts on volunteer activity. To think that computer scientists, in general, don't have the spare money or time to do this makes you the naive one who doesn't understand the industry.

Nothing I can do can make the panoply of free computer science textbooks go away. They are here to stay. They are not going anywhere. Whether anyone chooses to use them is up to the individuals trying to learn computer science. In my opinion, the bravery of going against the herd and using OER more than rewards the brave when they get paid to be a programmer with little or no debt. They can invest that money that would go to loans into index funds, and become financially independent very eary in life if they maintain their frugal ways. That's the market rewarding risk. But just like holding bonds is actually the risky move, going into debt in order to achieve a "traditional" college education is actually the risky move, because [college costs 64 times the sticker price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGeFiplIw5s). Sometimes it's risky not to be risky. If you avoid or disparage open source because you think it's marxist, you're avoiding the benefit of avoiding debt when young. You're telling people it's not possible to learn computer science for free through public libraries. No wonder thought like that is coming from PluralSight, who expects you to pay $200 for the latest and greatest educational videos. Of course PluralSight is scared of the open source educational market. Even the low-cost ($200/year) providers of education are now threatened by OER. It's now absurd to spend any money on computer science education. There is very little justification for spending a cent on learning to program. Everything necessary is free. The genie is not going back in the bottle any time soon. This is what disruption of industry means. This is what the internet engenders. Networking and open source licensing is a powerful force. Combine that with the sheer motivation of volunteers and you're creating something that's practically unstoppable. Good luck resisting the force for change from the effort of volunteer scientists.

Volunteering in the open source space can create compounding returns. It's like volunteering squared, it doubles the effort of any volunteer input when it's open sourced. That's why Github was bought by Microsoft, and OER is replacing the traditional $200 college textbook. Combine volunteering with open source and you get disruption of the status quo. Since open source is de facto volunteer work, but works on the D.R.Y. principle, you can cover a lot of territory with very little effort. The educational industry is changing, and I want people to know that relying on volunteer efforts doesn't mean you're disadvantaged or stunted in your education. It's actually a really great opportunity that people in the past would have killed for. Seize the opportunity and turn your life around! That's what people who create open source want! That's why people volunteer their time! Make use of OER and OCW! To not use it would be silly. Debt when you're young is disastrous because it prevents you from investing at an early age and earning compounding interest for decades. Use your knowledge of investing learned from [Holm School/free-index-funds-books](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-04-Free-Index-Funds-Books.html) (i.e. JL Collins's Stock Series) with the Frugality of Mr. Money Mustache and the affordable education curriculum of Holm School and you can lead a rewarding life that even might result in you contributing to open source when you're older and successful! That's the feedback loop that is changing the world faster than many people are even aware (or more likely are in denial about). No more student loans, no more debt, no more lost earnings going to an overpriced degree.

## #7 - Online Learning is Superior to In-Person Learning

Okay, hear me out. I know you guys will think I'm stupid even suggesting this, but in this blog post I want to discuss the reason online learning is superior to in-person learning.

There is a belief that online learning means complete social isolation. You don't talk to anyone. You don't socialize or talk about books or ideas with classmates. To which I say: Bullshit. You literally have spent the past 18 years of your life building up a social network in your hometown that is more robust than anything else in your life. The reason college even looks like a social experience is because you are placed in an environment with other able-minded kids. The only problem with that is you're an expat of your hometown. You have left your robust 18-year old social network to live four years in a new city while being voluntarily broke, spending money on mandatory housing instead of living in your parent's house in your hometown. Do you know how much rent is? Probably not, you're only 18 years old. Rent is atrocious, it is so expensive in college towns you'll never recover from the debt of paying rent while you're not working even if you're having a "social blast."

The issue is self-reinforcing, because even if you stay in your hometown and study online for free, your social network is going to get rocked. All your friends are moving away to cities to attend prestigious unversities. The cost of these universities is so high they will be obligated to work in cities, your hometown could never provide the salary to pay back your massive student loans. So at age 18, your robust social network is absolutely blasted to smithereens. I'm even willing to suggest this is the reason most kids suffer with mental illness during college, because they're placed in a stupidly expensive and hence stressful environment when they're earning no income, and they're supposed to talk to their friends through thefacebook.com. Bullshit, I say! Stay in your damn hometown with your friends and start careers in your hometown along with all your other friends, who study online debt-free rather than moving to cities all over the frickin map. If you're smart enough to go to college, and you don't think your hometown has jobs for the profession you want to go into, start a damn company at age 22. Don't think you need a super duper credential to get a job that pays well in order to pay off your super duper credential. Just live in your hometown, get a debt-free computer science degree, then be a remote programmer in your hometown and socialize with your friends who didn't move away either. The idea that you need to move to a new city in order to learn UNDERGRADUATE material (which isn't even that difficult, i.e. you just need to read a lot of books) is what is tearing American youth up and spitting them out into a world of student debt crises. It's the silliest idea I've ever heard.

I moved back to my hometown after college because I want to be a contributing member to my hometown, not the city where I went to college. This was a good choice, as I avoided debt during the Great Recession even while unemployed. The safety net in your hometown is more robust than anything the counseling center at your private university can offer you. It is not natural to move to a big city to read some books you can read free online, and then move to an even bigger city to pay off the massive debt your accrued in your previous big city. No wonder people hold on to "social networking" sites as if they were the most precious thing in the world. People literally don't have any friends in real life because they're moving around to a different city every four years. It's bullshit to keep this bad strategy in full effect when online learning is so good and affordable and all hometowns have the internet. You can work remotely as a programmer if there are no programming jobs in your hometown. You do not need to move away from your hometown, unless you want to. You sure don't need to go into debt just to justify the move to yourself.

Now, this is the point where I get harsh. Do you have "fake friends" at work? i.e. the people you aren't really friends with, but the people you consider your friends just because you work with them and they're relatively nice? People you would eat lunch with, even every day, but not anyone you would socialize with if you ever left your job and got a new one? This is what college acquaintances are. They are "fake friends" in the sense that your friendship is so tied to this silly system of going into debt for such a superfluous thing as a "prestigious degree" that it's basically a job. Your college friends are just "fake friends", they are friends and you are glad they are your co-workers, but once you move to a different job they are people you will probably never socialize with again. Contrast this to your high school friends. They are the people you grew up with, the people whose house you played in and families you know. How many family members of your college friends you know? Absolutely zero. I met one brother during my five years as an undergraduate. These are not the robust social networks that get pitted as a reason why in-person learning is better than online learning. These are "fake friends." To think that you're going to develop more as a person attending this silly ritual known as college just because you're forced to talk about books for a few hours a week than if you stay in your hometown and talk about books with your actual friends, is ridiculous. If all your friends stay in your hometown, and your friends branch into new social networks, your social network is also going to grow to such a degree that you'll find an academy worth of friends to talk about books just because your hometown friends are studying, working, or socializing in new ways now that you're out of high school. Who do you enjoy talking about books more? Your "fake friends", i.e. classmates in your Great Books class, or your actual friends that you grew up with and, sure, maybe the discussion is a little less high brow than in a Great Books conference, but has much more meaning and permanence? Who cares that you understand Kierkegaard better thanks to your prestigious university degree when you only socialize with your high school friends through thefacebook.com? Give me a break. I'm just saying, thefacebook.com came out of Harvard, and that's the shitty scene where shitty scenes like thefacebook.com (and all other social networks) thrive, because mandatory "fake friends" requires the performativity of enjoying your fake friends. Thefacebook.com is fake friends taken to its logical extreme. Fake friends is the most important thing in the world to a college student, that's why they're all on online social networks instead of living life meaningfully. You've lost all your real friends, because you all thought the only way to succeed in life was to get a prestigious degree, and you're left living in a city where you know no one, working in an academic job with cutthroat coworkers who don't give a crap about you, spending your fridays on thefacebook.com instead of spending it with the friends with whom you grew up.

So when people tell me that in-person classes are better than online classes, I demand to know the caveats. First, you're leaving your real friends in order to enact this performativity of REALLY LIKING YOUR COLLEGE FRIENDS SOOOOO MUCH (through some shitty social network online) because you had to move away. You're going deeper and deeper into debt when you could just be reading the same books and learning the same things free from the stacks at your local public library. Your professors hate you in secret because you're reeling from the reality of leaving your real friends for no reason other than you've been brainwashed you'll be a failure if you don't get an expensive university degree, and maybe (JUST MAYBE) struggle a bit mentally in terms of your ability to succeed in your classwork (for a look into into the pretentious heart of professors, just read the blog "Rate Your Students" online). The idea that the appropriate action for a group of smart high school friends is to separate permanently and go to different colleges in different cities WHEN THE REASON YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAD A DEVELOPED AND MATURE SOCIAL NETWORK IN HIGH SCHOOL is problematic. Instead you could just self-educate yourselves in the fairly easy undergraduate material then start a business together in your hometown, is why the student debt crisis is a crisis and not just a curious earmark of history. This system is bullshit, and the same reason people buy luxury goods is the same reason your high school friends disappeared on you at age 18, only to appear as 100px*100px avatars on thefacebook.com. It's not their fault, it's just the bullshit consumer culture we live in, where expensive goods have to be paid by high salaried jobs that are only acquired by getting a high prestige university degree, which means believing in-person classes are infinitely better than online learning.

"Online learning" is a travesty, people say (mostly professors). The reason is because those people sold their soul to get their professorial positions. They have no friends, they're living in some weird place they didn't grow up in. They don't like teaching kids, they don't like the kids because they don't understand what it means to have a cogent hometown culture of whom those kids are a part. It's just blasting through "opportunity" after "opportunity" -- "enlightening the townies" -- collecting their stupid paychecks while ruining kids lives with the money they sap from them through non-bankruptable student loans. That's a broken system, and personally I am much more of the opinion that getting a college education without EVER interacting with a college professor is the REASON I'm such an advocate of online learning. College professors are horrible people, truly some of the worst people I have ever met in my life. They are so unempathetic you truly feel as if they hadn't come from rich family they would be psychopaths ruining peoples lives as terrible managers at a local fast food chain. The difference between a good manager and your professors is like night and day. Managers are saints compared to professors. Managers expect quality from you, professors view everything you do as just proof that they are soooo smart and all these so-called "gifted" students who SOMEHOW got into college are soooo stupid in comparison to their inherent brilliance. These people need to shrivel up and stop getting phat paychecks from innocent kids who just want to contribute to society and learn a few things. The transfer of wealth from innocent kids to weirdo liberal arts professors is one of the greatest problems in the world today. Almost every interaction I had with a professor was just horrible while I was in at a liberal arts college, it's unbelievable how different the real world is compared to liberal arts school. Professors truly stop at nothing to try and destroy your life. So when people tell me you can educate yourself online and NEVER INTERACT WITH A SINGLE PROFESSOR, I don't say "oooooh, it'll never replace in-person learning." I say "HELL YES, EDUCATION WITHOUT THE PROFESSOR ATTACHED TO IT IS THE BEST IDEA EVER!!!" Strip the academy from the professor, make it impossible for them to even communicate with kids, and you are saving the world from immense suffering and pain.

Replace the professor with your social network from high school, which is still in-tact because you're all studying online in your family's home from age 18-22 and you're all next door neighbors. Your high school friends are INFINITELY better professors than the mercenaries that pass as 'professors' today. I promise you I've learned more from my high school friends than from any professor I paid tens of thousands of dollars to a year. I wish I could give my high school friends tens of thousands of dollars instead of my so-called professors. When's the last time you "professed" to your professor, instead of your best friends? They're the real professors. You haven't met the most pathetic creature in the world until you've interacted with a liberal arts professor as a subservient student. You don't need a professor to explain a book to you. My experience shows they don't even understand it themselves. You can just read it yourself and understand the book better. You can ask your friend to read the book, and then a week later discuss your questions with them. What the point of discussing books when you have zero social context with your professors or classmates? Your professors know nothing about you, your college classmates know nothing about you. Only your real friends can take a book and contextualize it for your life in a meaningful way. Throwing money at it won't fix that problem, it's inherent to the system of university. Education requires context, and only something that happens IN YOUR HOMETOWN is going to have that context. Everything else is charades.

You can share in the process of educating yourself among your hometown friends from age 18-22, then start a company in your hometown when you "graduate" with your debt-free computer science degree from UoPeople at age 22. The idea that a professor makes the education is simply outsourcing. You don't need to outsource your education. Free books (library genesis) and free lectures (YouTube) are really all you need to self-educate. Bonus if your friends still live next door to you.

The fact that people haven't come up with a way to socialize with friends over books without the intervention of the mercenary called a professor is the reason lives are being destroyed over student debt. Holmschooling is a great solution to the notion you need to uproot yourself and move all over Dodge just to "succeed" in the world is the sort of lapse in critical thinking that creates horrible people like liberal arts professors who prey on these circumstances like vampires. These people lack critical thinking (despite purporting not to), and are profiting off the system that exploits innocent kids who succeeded in high school BECAUSE of their social network they developed during their first 18 years. The reason you're successful enough to get into a "prestigious" university is STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU: ITS YOUR HOMETOWN FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND YOUR CULTURE OF EDUCATION UP UNTIL THAT POINT. Don't leave it right when things are getting good because you think you'll wind up working at a fast food joint if you don't. Have some self-confidence and make the choice of your real friends over professors who exploit any weakness for cheap thrills and fake colleagues who are trying to generate enough cultural capital to keep their academic lives going through and through grad school and beyond, not realizing there's no carrot at the end of the stick. Forget that, if you can't get a PhD online (debt-free), then getting a PhD ISN'T WORTH GETTING. The only things in life worth getting are things that don't put yourself into debt. If something requires you to go into debt, it's a PYRAMID SCHEME and not an actual respectable thing to do. There is no such thing as "Good Debt." You either have enough money to pay for it up front or you don't.

Your hometown is so much more important than a prestigious degree. The more kids realize this and stay in their family homes next door to their best friends who are doing the same, to study online for free from 18-22 and then starting businesses in their hometown, the better!

I laugh when people say in-person education is better. How is education anything other than a personal process? All education is "in-person", because the only other person that should be involved in your education is you. You are inherently "in-person." You can't outsource your education by paying other people to talk about books with you. You need to talk about books with your hometown friends, when you have zero debt hanging over your head and are stressed free and holding reading discussions at your local park (or are instead making great money as a computer scientist with tuition reimbursements to pay completely for your online studying or book budget). Guess what? Books are flipping free on the internet. You don't need to go to a different city just to read some books. You can library genesis them, Perlego them, or just ask for them at your public library through interlibrary loans. You don't need to spend a cent to educate yourself, let alone pay the salary of someone who doesn't give a shit about you and whose life is dedicated to "the life of the mind" in words only because they're working SO HARD grading papers (lol) while getting paid shit because universities exploit everyone, so they're miserable people and want to make you miserable too as a hazing ritual. Separate the wheat from the chaffe and just read the books online for free. Library Genesis/Perlego/Archive.org is one of the most important inventions ever, because it breaks the brain washing we have in our world that being smart requires spending massive amounts of money on paper books and classes. Guess what? Being smart means you don't need to spend a cent on education! That's the reason you're smart, you don't need to outsource a single damn thing! Because you can teach yourself from open source/free/online materials. You don't need a professor, because you don't want to become a professor anyway. [Professors are in a cult.](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-Graduate-School-a-Cult-/44676) They behave very weirdly, and you wind up feeling very sorry for them. You don't want to interact with cult members rather than your life long friends, trust me. Cut the fat from your life and live the life you want to live, not the life these cult members want you to live.

Stay in your hometown. Live at home and study online from age 18-22. Get a UoPeople computer science degree even if you want a liberal arts degree instead. Read the books you want to read through Library Genesis or Perlego in your free time while studying CS at UoPeople. Take an extra year to get your degree if that allows you to study more literature than you would otherwise. Get a debt-free CS degree no matter what type of career you actually want to do in life. Live in your hometown with your real friends.

Liberal arts is a great hobby to have, but not a good degree to have. The fact that liberal arts college scoff at the idea of missing out on in-person education is one of the reasons the liberal arts college degree is a bad idea. If something can't be made free and open source through technology, it has no purpose in the modern world. Don't misrepresent me to think I'm saying the liberal arts has no purpose. Anyone can read Great Books free through their public library or LibGen. But since a liberal arts "education" (i.e. college) can't be digitized for free and made open source, your actual free option -- public library + LibGen -- is better. That's because things that enrich your life -- books, movies, music, culture -- should only cost about $15 a month in the digital world we live in where file replication is free and easy. Paying anything more than that is speculation in an attempt to get returns on something in exchange for the cultural capital of consuming a "luxury" good such as physical classes. You're paying people more money in hopes that you earn more money in return due to having a good that is not $15 a month. Paying more money to get paid more in return is also known as a PYRAMID SCHEME. In this day and age, education costs $15 a month, period. If you're paying more than that, you're buying into a pyramid scheme. Or just hoping you're going to get laid.

It's amazing how fruitful the world can be to computer scientists, who have built a completely free computer science self-education pipeline through the hard work of volunteer authors and programmers. I truly believe open source computer science education is the eighth wonder of the world, in which a plentiful life where you can retire from a working career in ten years after paying absolutely nothing in education costs to get to the point where you can be employed as a computer scientist. No other department has that, and when people ask me where to learn to program, do you think I point them to their local university, who charges $5000 every four months? No, I point them to open source OER or cheap EdTech like Raspberry Pis or Treehouse. It's because to do otherwise would be to ignore the BEST UNIVERSITY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD called the internet. HARVARD SUCKS in comparison to the internet. THE IVY LEAGUE is a joke compared to the internet. For the cost of broadband, you can get the BEST EDUCATION IN THE WORLD. HOW MUCH DOES THE BEST EDUCATION IN THE WORLD COST? Well, it's a lot less expensive than Harvard! It's about $30 a month! Free if you use the public library's broadband connection. Why would I ever tell someone not to go to the best education in the world for an inferior version that just so happens to cost about 200 times as much per year! To think you can learn more at Harvard in a year than a year studying on the internet using LibGen, OER, your public library, or Perlego just doesn't match with logic or reality.

I realize that people don't understand open source, and so for that reason don't understand that computer science education is free on the internet. Everything is free on the internet, or else $15 a month for the deluxe version. People have built a university for computer science that is the best in the world, and yet it's free on the internet. To complain that this free university doesn't have professors is to miss the forest for the trees. Somehow, there are tons of people who are living successful lives as internet-educated computer scientists, who are so debt free they can retire after 10 years of work with a high savings rate, yet the message still isn't getting through to *all potential students* that university is deprecated and they should just get a CS degree from UoPeople no matter what they want to do in life. Am I concerned? No, I know this will be the path of the future in just a few years time. It's impossible to argue with open source when it's literally taking over the world. Good engineering and efficiency just overwhelm any other consideration, including "in-person" classes. If you want in-person classes, start an in-person class with your old friends and new in the living room of your house. Have a syllabus and read books on Perlego. This isn't rocket science, if you view something as important, act upon it. It's just that this important thing doesn't need to cost anyone any money, it should be $15 a month because everything in the world is now $15 a month. Spotify is $15 a month. Perlego is $15 a month. College education is $15 a month. Does moving to a big city in order to read physical books in a gothic library $15 a month? I friggin doubt it. Does living in your family home and starting a reading group with your hometown friends you've known your entire life cost $15 a month? Yes. Public domain books are free. Open source OER is free. It costs nothing to ride your bike to your neighbor's house for a weekly reading group. That's what holmschooling is. It's understanding that open source has changed the world by solving a whole lot of problems. One of those problems is education. Education is $15 a month, period. Nitpicking and including "add-ons" like in-person discussions in completely different cities with people you don't know is almost so unnecessary as to be pathological. You don't need to do anything related to education that requires you do something you can't do on your bicycle. If you can't ride your bike from your family home to college classes, you shouldn't take that college class. If you have to fly on an airplane and pay rent when you don't have an income to attend classes because you view it as the only path to success in life, you shouldn't take that college class. It's just that simple. Online learning is possible on just a bike. That's the sniff test for education in 2020. Just buy a Raspberry Pi and sit back and work your butt off until you're employed in your hometown for just a couple hundred dollars a year. Your friends will still be near you, you'll be able to contribute to the community that raised you, and you'll find that success doesn't require an expensive piece of paper certificate. Education is something that you do on your own with friends, your neighborhood, and computers and bikes. To think it requires debt it untrue and morally wrong.

Ignore open source at your own peril. Open source doesn't require professors and gothic libraries and lecture halls. Open source exists on a $55 Raspberry Pi and results in financial independence in your thirties. You can choose the life of a traditional academic if that's what you prefer, but you're hoping that future education won't be 100% online, 100% free, and 100% open source. That's not a bet I'm willing to take, after reading the writing on the wall through my research as an art historian with a focus on the sociology of education who also happens to be a computer scientist. When a Spotify for Books comes out (and Perlego makes a good first attempt), the gloves are coming off and you'll find what you went hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt for has been replaced with an app for $15 a month. This will obviously cause some strong emotions, but if you don't understand that everything can be digitized will be digitized and is bound to become free or just a few dollars on the internet, maybe even paid for through a banner ad, you probably aren't actually an intellectual, no matter how harsh that sounds. For all the "culture" these people with PhDs have studied and proven themselves to deserve, they don't realize that computer science is in the driver's seat of world wide culture. This is a good thing, not a bad thing, no matter what these luddite cultists say. Culture has always been the same as technology, and good culture is always developing out of good technology. The fact that they'll have to find new jobs doesn't change the fact that open source has won. Rather than perpetuating a system that demands huge debt and essentially slavery, they will be replaced by a system that demands freedom and liberty and no money. That's because that's the trajectory of humankind, to replace slavery with freedom and liberty. People will look back at the academic system we had when I was a kid as a form of oppression. Professors are both perpetuators and victims of this oppression. So when people say online learning lacks in-person classes, I simply respond that in-person classes supported a system of oppression that affected all of humanity. It has been replaced, never to return. If you think that is bad, my guess if you're a liberal arts professor.

The only gatekeeper to your education is YOU. A professor, no matter how hard they try, can never be your gatekeeper. That's because you don't need a professor to learn. A recording of a professor substitutes just fine. A recording can't gatekeep, can't tell you you're not living up to your potential, can't tell you how disappointed they are in you. Because the only gatekeeper when it comes to education is the gatekeeping you enact upon yourself, whether that means not living up to your potential or disappointing yourself. The only person to make those judgments is yourself, not somebody who's known you for five weeks. Online learning is gatekeeper-less, and the fact that it's not in-person is one of its best justifications. No one else can gatekeep your education except yourself. The only way you can gatekeep yourself is to go so far into debt paying gatekeepers that you can't fund your own self-education. That's a choice a disturbing amount of people have chosen. Unschooling is a choice to take control of your education and put it in the hands of your hometown community that you trust and have grown up in instead of a slick university that has well-designed lookbooks and that's the reason you're giving them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Teaching yourself at your public library is free. Teaching yourself through Library Genesis is free. When you're employed and maxing out your 401k and IRA every year in your twenties and putting the spare dollars into your brokerage account, you're not going to care that you missed out on interacting with professors for a few years. They don't give a shit about you, and you shouldn't give a shit about them. You don't owe them anything. They haven't earned your money or time. They haven't earned their authority. Your efforts are only for you and your community. Think about what you can do for your friends and family when you're financially independent in your thirties. All of this is possible through online learning. To anyone who denies this, doesn't really understand the situation. They don't really know the possibilities that exist on the internet regarding education. It's only going to get better. Many volunteers are working hour after hour ensuring that the internet remains the best university in the world. In my opinion, online DIY educations are the most prestigious degrees out there. Not that I care about prestige, I care about what you do for your community and friends.

The most prestigious university is the one that improves the lives of all humankind the most. In my opinion, that university is the internet. Perhaps you'd like to enroll at this prestigious university? Good news! Tuition is free thanks to the Aupansorse family scholarship. If you benefit from this scholarship, perhaps you'd like to contribute back by creating some more educational content for future students to add to the university "Geitthaub Library." As tuition is free at our university, you can be sure that everyone in the world who turns 18 can benefit from whatever content you choose to donate regardless of their wealth. Within a few decades we hope everyone in the world can enroll in our university and earn a degree. Not bad for a university established just 40 years ago! Let's just say we're quite unlike any of our competitors, we operate on a different business plan thanks to the Aupansorse family scholarships, one of the largest endowments in the world. Our library stack for example, is the most extensive book collection in all of human history, and totally available for instaneous download at the click of a button for all students! We truly believe our school will improve the lives of our alumni more than any other university in the world.

Hard to compete with that. And 100% true. I wish university were justified, books iz kool, but from my perspective it's malignant and enslaving generation after generation to perpetual debt.

No one cares about your master's degree. Yes, even your master's degree in computer science. No one should be spending the early years of their life paying other people to have an excuse to read books. If you want to do that, don't spend money on it. Just do it in your bedroom, using Library Genesis or inter-library loans, and self-educating. The idea that you paid someone to read books yourself just so you earned a certificate is meaningless in the world today. Anyone can read any book ever written for free through LibGen. That you paid money to read it in a big Gothic university library instead of your childhood bedroom doesn't mean shit. The purpose is to fix the world. You don't leverage the freedom to do that by putting yourself in debt at an early age. You leverage freedom by reading books online for free and then using your debt-free edu-punk lifestyle to fuel a career in which you fix the world's problem due to you not needing to work at this or that job to pay your student loans. You could even do open source, since you're debt free.

Fixing something should be done with as minimal up-front cost as possible. Given that you are a computer scientist, you are going to try and fix problems in the world through programming. Why do you need student loan debt in order to feel prepared to fix problems? Student loan debt actually hinders your ability to fix things. You don't focus on what needs to be fixed, you focus on what services you can provide to someone else's problem (not the world's problems) just to earn a paycheck. When it comes down to it, a master's degree just shows that you spent a lot of money in order to read books. With a nearly complete catalog of computer science books online for free, what's the point of even having a master's? Just to prove that you've read those books? Why not just read them for free, then prove you've read them by fixing the problem that needs to be fixed? If you fix a problem, people won't care whether you did so with a master's degree under your belt or not. You obviously know the subject material, or else you wouldn't have been able to fix it, do you really need an expensive degree to verify publically that you read the books? Just read the books, get it over with, remain as debt-free as you humanly can, and then go out and fix the problem you spent two years researching for free in your bedroom. You don't need Gothic architecture to do that.

In a world where every book is now free on the internet, my general feeling is this: getting a master's degree (on your own dime, instead of your employer's) is just signaling that you felt you deserved more infrastructure than a laptop with an internet connection. You needed professors, libraries, buildings, and student unions in order to read those books you read. Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but was the cost worth it? It seems a little inefficient to need huge expensive buildings and assistants just to do the deed of reading a hundred or so books. Can't you just read the books, then save the difference? Why do you need a campus, with lawn care and security personnel and food service, just to get you to read some books? Anyone can read those same exact books for free in their bedroom. It's not a mark of pride that you did that with a metric ton of infrastructure. No one cares that you paid the salary of hundreds of people with nonbankruptable loans along the way of reading those books. It just comes off as stupid because you wasted your own money just to avoid the "stigma" of being an online learner. Because online learners are apparently losers in the world of academia. Of course they are talked about in that way by people who went to college, academia's bottom line relies on nobody replacing their libraries with Library Genesis or an alternative.

People operate on a lot of fear, fear that they'll be viewed as lesser because they don't have the proper accolades and titles of someone of prestige. That's why they pay for master's degrees. But being a person that views their prestige based on the amount of stuff they're able to fix, with minimum cost and overhead, is a badass way to approach the issue of education. Who cares that you're self-taught when you can do amazing things on a computer? Who cares that you didn't spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to enroll as a student at a univresity when you read the same curriculum for free? Who cares when you earn prestige based on what you fix, not on what school you went to? No one cares about your master's degree. Fix something, dumbass, fix something!

## #5 - It Takes a Special Type of Person to Make Open Courseware

This is somewhat a continuation of #18 - online learning is superior to in-person education. I want to clarify that this is not some clickbait article. I truly feel online learning is superior to in-person (higher) education.

The simple fact is, since you have to pay for higher education, that should be a HUGE SIGNAL that it is unnecessary in life. Nothing that is essential to life costs a lot of money. Is food expensive? Not really if you eat whole food plant-based vegan. Is bicycling expensive? Not if you bicycle instead of driving. Why is university so expensive? Because it's an inessential good, a veblen product that only signifies how much spare money you have to burn that you would PAY SOMEONE ELSE to read some books instead of just reading the books yourself from the public library interlibrary loan system. That's the only reason college is expensive, don't believe it has anything to do with cut funding by governments or anything else. It's because it's inessential and inessential goods are expensive in a free-trade, globalized world.

Here's the kicker: There are people whose lives are planned and organized around the possibility of making a lot of money educating other people. Do you think learning calculus requires a lot of money? No, it literally takes a book and a calculator. Do you think learning undergraduate material requires a lot of money? No, undergraduate material is so easy you can get an undergraduate education in computer science for around $300 a year at Treehouse. Learning can easily be done without a professor through OER and OCW. So my question to you is, do you want to pay people that deliberately ignore this fact and plan their lives to extract the most wealth out of teaching kids calculus and how to code simple apps? The people that charge you $60,000 a year to read some "Great Books" curriculum and talk for three hours a week about what you read? I'm not sure why anyone would pay $60,000 to someone to read some public domain books, but yet people aren't just donating $60,000 to a good cause along with reading their books, they're actually giving their money to the very people who attempt to make education as expensive as possible to line their pockets at your expense.

Now, let me just note that there are people who do not attempt to profit from educating you. These people are the authors of Open Educational Resources and Open Courseware. They willing forego any profit from their labor, and volunteer their abilities to the world THROUGH THE INTERNET. That's because the internet requires no money to distribute material, but additionally has the potential of reaching nearly everyone in the english-speaking world. It's like solar power - it's nearly free energy, but the energy is educational energy. Just like solar panels are gift from space aliens (read: engineers) to bless humanity, OER/OCW is a gift from space aliens (read: engineers) to bestow free eduation. Because guess what? In-person higher education is not a necessity, but online higher education is a necessity. It's a necessity because it requires zero cost, just some volunteer labor from a few individuals, but also is free. Necessary things are affordable. Online learning is affordable because it is a necessity in the world. OER and Open Courseare are free because it is a necessity.

People come out of the 00's thinking online learning is a hack that silently needs to die. What they don't realize is that online learning is the very essence of essentiality. There is nothing more important in the world than free online learning. That's why people are literally bending over backwards attempting to build a college-equivalent education through OER and OCW. The project itself is complete, in my opinion, we're now just over-doing the deed to put additional flourishments and embellishments to the core. Just because 100% of the world isn't doing something doesn't mean it's not the essence of essentiality. Farming is essential but how many people in the world are farmers? Likewise, not everyone in the world creates OCW/OER, but yet it is essential to the world after the creation of the internet. The few OER creators, like the few farmers, are providing an essential service, even if the reward is low monetary-wise and nearly passes as volunteer labor. Likewise, that's because not everyone in the world needs to be an OER creator, because it is efficient (D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself), you only need one textbook on a subject for the entire english-speaking world, and modern technology has made the yields tremendous given the inputs. It's now easy to produce bounties of food, just like it's eays to produce a global library of books by a small population of OER writers.

My question to you is: Who do you want to give your money to? The person who charges you $5000 a month for access to books? Or Perlego, who charges you $12 a month to books? Or the OER authors who charge you $0 a month for books? My guess is, you would rather give your money to the people that aren't exploiting you. The people who don't necessitate a transfer of wealth just to learn some basic STEM topics. Those people are basically heros, and would you rather learn from heros or exploiters? Personally, as I feel the educational experience is magical and mysterious, I would rather spend my time with the people who create free/affordable online content. The people who can pay for their service through a simple ad banner? They probably have the ideology that I like, the tastes that I jive with, the morals and ethics that I appreciate. The people who are making bank while ripping off kids are almost Dickensian in their exploitation of children.

It takes a special type of person to make open courseware. It's basically proof in the pudding that you are a cool person, and have the right brain for the duty. Someone who would sacrifice money or fame and enable people to have essential learning, all for free.

Now people would say, "You can't learn through the internet." And that's why they're wrong. Learning takes place through books and videos, just like in in-person education. But the difference is in-person learning requires the use and payment of people who attempt to make you as big of consumerist of higher education as possible. The people who sell you the idea that you too can be a professor who teaches people and earns a lot of money. People think, "Golly gee, I'm paying out my ass to this professor, having higher education certificates must be awesome!" And that's why colleges keep charging more, otherwise people would question whether being a teacher is a wise investment. And guess what, it's frigging not, educators get paid on the level of farmers. Yet, colleges are in the business of selling the higher education lifestyle, hoping you'll pay all the way up past undergraduate to graduate and PhD. So the more you pay the professor, they know, they more you'll keep paying. It's a feedback loop which can burn you for life if you're not aware of the feedback loop, which colleges do their best to hide from students through ceremony and pomp.

So when people say, "an internet education isn't as good as an in-person college," I say bullshit, because learning from OER+OCW writers is literally the best education possible. It's like assembling a power group. Do you know what a power group is? It's when four different members of the four best bands in a region join up and start a new band together. OER is a power group of the best, most kind-hearted, and unexploitative educators in the world. And guess what? Education from them blasts the world out of in-person education, for the very reason that they are the best, most kind-hearted, and unexploitative educators in the world. Yet I'm supposed to believe this education is inferior, just because it was delivered from the internet? Bullshit. Free education mandates that it be through the internet, there will never be free in-person education. The very fact that it is through the internet is a sort of certificate that it is the best education possible. In-person education's only verification method that it is "good" is the cost of the in-person education? LOL, what a feedback-loop scam. That internet education is free is proof that it isn't a scam. Who gets scammed for zero dollars? Who feels like they wasted their time spending zero dollars? If you want to know the best way to spend your time, it's through activities and projects that are free or a couple bucks. That's why so many people drink of college, to promote the idea that a fun time or good decision is based around spending a lot of money. The entire system of higher education teaches this so-called "lesson" over and over again, which is why so many people blow their life savings reading some books and talking to a professor for 3 hours a week.

Guess what? The best education can never be in-person. Stop looking for it. The best education will 100%, absolutely, never without circumstance come through the internet. That's because the best education doesn't mean shit if it's not scalable, deliverable to everyone in the world for free. If you're getting the best education, but your neighbor down the street isn't or can't, then it isn't the best education in the world. Yet through the internet, anyone can receive an education through the volunteer labor of some truly selfless people. Scientists and writers and engineers who know that the future is online learning, not brick and mortar colleges. In 100 years, in-person learning will be a joke, a history footnote that people use to have to pay money to learn before the internet was inventive. People will view it as the world before agriculture, a sort of hipster fantasy where hunting and gathering would be way cool and anti-civilization, but in reality only for the hunter gathering groups at expense of the entire world population. If you ever want to see hipsters in their prime, read some green anarchy zines. What putzes! Internet education is basically modern medicine, and only people very caught up in themselves as intelligent (Dunning-Kruger effect) promote not using modern medicine.

Do you like modern medicine, and all the luxuries it affords you? Do you want to promote modern medicine to the cavemen who would rather destroy civilization, agriculture, etc? Then fine, there will be people who would take your money in return for an affirmation that the internet is dumb, stupid, an ersatz service compared to hunting and gathering. Yet those people won't give a shit about you, or society, or children, or the future after they take your money and throw you out after four years. Or 4-10 years if you buy into this cult and get a masters or PhD.

There are people who want you to learn. And not just you, at the expense of your neighbor or at someone across the globe. They want to educate everyone with free books and lectures, sent to you without any compensation in return. They don't demand obeisance in the classroom, essays and discussions that demand your compliance in their ideology, and frittered work that benefits them and not anyone else outside of this one central authority. There is no authority in putting a digital book or digital lecture on the internet. You don't gain authority, fame, money, or clicks. What you do is contribute to the public domain, and people that contribute to the public domain are basically building the pro-science, pro-democracy, pro-capitalism, pro-justice future that everyone should desire. This is the ideology you want to consume, to create the NEXT ideology that benefits and improves the world for everyone. The public domain is the closest thing to utopia, and I don't say that lightly. If you don't understand that the public domain is like Artifical Intelligence for society, I suggest you study the public domain when combined with computers. Or whatever comes after computers. For the rest of humanity's time here on Earth.

Do I care that I'm promoting an education method that people believe is inferior to "real" college? No. I am sharing my experience with college and as an amateur sociology of education researcher. And as a secular humanist. Online education is almost the quintessential secular humanist pursuit, and the funny part is it really doesn't need a lot more than existing infrastructure. It's almost a done deal, it's in-the-bag, it's a solved problem. Anyone can get a college-equivalent education through OER/OCW. Yet, just like the other thing that secular humanists care about, people are brainwashed by an anti-democratic religion. The religion is the worshipping of college certification and rankings. The hierarchy of "truth" that is apparently earned not through morals and ethics, but through anti-democratically being at the top of the education hierarchy. Is college meritocratic? If it were free for everyone in the world. Is online learning meritocratic? It is rapidly approaching being free for everyone in the world. And that's why I think you should decide to never pay for educational material again. Because if you really needed to learn it, it would be free. And the great part is, it is! Because online learning is necessary, not in-person college.

The fact that at the moment, the way society is organized, that the best teachers make OER/OCW only makes it easier to make the decision to user OER. It's like a "google" for professors, in which you can query the entire corpus of human education just by searching for OER and filtering out the fluff. Cut the fat and fluff out of your life and live in a humanist world of free education for all, and education without exploitation and student loans. Just go to your public library and check out an ipad and see what humanist education is and means. The internet exists BECAUSE it is the vision of humanist educators. It was created for this very purpose, to solve this very problem. To bemoan that it doesn't interact with you as a professor answers question is silly. We're just a few decades away from creating an AI that probably will offer that experience, anyway. Do you want to continue the loop of paying a lot of money to be "educated" enough to create the AI that enables a free professor in everyones bedroom? My guess is, if you enter college with that intention you'll quickly be brainwashed away into the dark side of trying to make as much money as possible by providing a professor in only-the-rich's bedroom. And while that may be a stepping stone, it is not the final goal. The sooner you liberate yourself from rankings and prestige, the more likely you'll create the technology that makes everyone in the world more educated. And since I view being educated as very important, I thus view online learning as much more important to the world than in-person education. Any complaints about it in-the-moment are temporary and will be solved by Open Source Software. The public domain is the answer, not the red-headed stepchild to condescend to and trash talk on the way to cashing your royalties checks. People downloading your copyrighted material in digital form without paying you anything is innovation that benefits humanity, the essence of humanism. ["In a capitalist economy, the market rewards things that are rare and valuable."](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html) And that's why you can laugh tonight, thinking about how the most rare and valuable thing is providing things for free that used to cost money. Are google and apple not the most important companies on the planet? They enable affordable self-education, and are rewarded, since that's what the world most needs.

## #4 - Get the Cheapest Computer Science Degree(s) Possible, Then Move On With Your Life

I recently have been excited to find that I can access Kanopy through my old university email from the college in town, where I attended CS classes for 2 years. Kanopy has a complete collection of Criterion Collection DVDs as well as coming close to a complete collection of The Teaching Company lectures. TTC is a great company that creates slightly dumbed down college-level lectures for consumption. They used to cost a lot of money ($500 per class, if I remember correctly from 2003), but they have been digitized and have come down in cost. Bill Gates recommends Teaching Company lectures, and personally my retirement plans were going to be heavy on TTC lectures too. I was worried my Kanopy subscription would be invalidated, though, as soon as the university found out I wasn't an active student. And a few months ago they got rid of nearly all subscriptions (to TTC amongst others), only to reactivate their TTC subscriptions half a year later. Kanopy is very expensive, so it's a luxury I would literally drop out of college to consume 100% of the time if I were college-age. Having hundreds of TTC lectures is like sitting on a free university education. And since liberal arts degrees are worthless, I would rather learn from TTC instead of paying a whole lot for classes at a local university.

But recently I read an announcement from my local public library that they were doing curbside pickup after being closed for three months. I just needed to use their "Bibliocommons" app/website for which they pay. I quickly discovered that my public library had three copies of JL Collins now, whereas they had zero half a year ago. To top off my excitement, as I searched for art history, financial independence, home repair, and other books, I discovered that my public library had about 250 DVD sets of TTC classes. Oh my god, even though it matches the Kanopy subscription, even if my Kanopy account got nixed or they had to cut it because of budget cuts, my public library had the entire collection in physical format! This was a revelation to me, as I had no idea public libraries subscribed to TTC lectures as they are so expensive. But here they were, 250 lectures of which nearly 50% of them are interesting to me. I realized I had a lifetime of learning for free, as usual, thanks to my public library in Topeka.

That came a few hours after spending a few hours on Archive.org building out my Z-Degree curricula. Searching Archive.org for "Art History", for example, returned 500 books for free reading. Biology around 3000. Economics even more. Sure, some of these books were old, but I'm not sure economics has changed much since the 80s. And I didn't filter for new books, I'm sure there were dozens of modern economics textbooks for anyone interested in learning economics or biology. After finishing up the Z-Degree searching, I casually looked for "humanism" and found dozens of interesting books to read, which I favorited. I'm completely shocked at the sheer number and quality of books on Archive.org. Archive in combination with OER and a public library offers lifelong learning to anyone on every topic imaginable. It will take me years to read those 14 books on humanism I favorited, along with about 12 books by Erwin Panofsky. Lifelong learning is free for everyone. If you work as a computer scientist, you can become financially independent in 10-14 years and then spend the rest of your life learning whatever you want from Archive.org, OER, and your public library.

In which case, I realize the best strategy for human success is to get the cheapest degree possible, and then move on with your life. So this is a bit of a reiteration of The Barebone Baseline Degree Manifesto, but it almost doesn't matter what your degree is in, as anyone can teach themselves to code regardless of their undergraduate degree and find employment as a programmer. It just so happens that the cheapest degree possible, I think, is a computer science degree from UoPeople. It's just $4000 total. Working three hours a week would pay for it. So regardless of what you want to do in life, you should get the cheapest computer science degree possible and then spend the rest of your life learning whatever you want to know for free. Once you retire from programming in 14 years, you can study whatever liberal arts topic you want to know. Read any classic literature you want. Maybe work at a local organization you like, because pay doesn't matter.

The bad decision would be to spend tens of thousands of dollars (if not hundreds) getting a degree in what your passion is. In my experience, getting a degree in your passion is a good way to be financially insolvent your entire life. Colleges will glady take hundreds of thousands of dollars just because you find a topic interesting. But a degree is worthless, it does not enable you to do anything you couldn't do just by self-studying for free. Anyone can post their self-study curriculum of books they read on a website that serves as a resume, to verify they got a college-equivalent education. That will probably become standard practice in the future as online learning becomes the norm. I say you rank college degrees by cost, and get the cheapest degree possible. Cost should be the ultimate decider, not department or anything. Four years of your life is so insignificant in your life, it's one of the secrets of growing older. Those 300 or so books I read in my undergraduate studies pale in comparison to the thousands of books I've read since turning 22. To think that those thousands of books were free through the public library, yet those 300 or so books I read at college cost me $300 each, just shows how stupid college is. A book is a book. You don't need to pay for a book, when books are free. College is just gamified reading, and unfortunately it costs you a shit ton. Do I need to pay someone else for the motivation to read books today, at age 35? Hell no, I do it because I love it and it is the best hobby in the world. Why I paid an institution $300 to read a book, hundreds of time over, is a question that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

Since UoPeople is so affordable, and computer science is so interesting (even to humanities buffs), I suggest getting a UoPeople degree because it is sooooo cheap. Your skills will take over your career path, not your degree. Your interests will take over your career choices, not your degree. And interests bloom through free and affordable learning. If education weren't affordable, it wouldn't be sustainable (and that's why colleges aren't sustainable in the modern world). Free education is essentially what lifelong learning is. You should graduate from whatever school that is cheapest to you. I don't care if it has a terrible name, is 100% online, is philanthropy, has no prestige, or isn't regionally accredited. Just get your stupid, meaingless degree, as the strange ritual that is required in America, and then move on with your life and fuel your lifelong learning for free. Your lifelong learning is what will take you down interesting paths and fun adventures. It's not your college degree. Anyone can do anything regardless of their undergraduate degree (except maybe be a medical doctor or lawyer). Get the cheapest degree available to you, study what you really like on the side, and then work as a programmer for 14 years to enable a life where you can do literally study anything you want as long as it is cheap. And guess what, a whole lot more studying is cheap thanks to advances in public libraries and OER the past decade! And it will be even cheaper in the future. If you postpone your passions for just a single decade, you can potentially pursue your passion interruptions free for the rest of your life. That's an incredible bargain, and bargaining yourself out of this possibility just because you think a college degree is the easiest way to express what you love to friends and employers is a terrible bargain.

Get financial independence through programming, then do open source projects in the field you love. Make sure your activities are open source, just like open source enabled you to get a $4000 undergraduate degree. Never feel that your life is hindered because you don't have a prestigious degree. That's the type of stuff that doesn't matter when you die. What you can do when your passions are truly unleashed, free from financial concerns, is what enables world changing activities. If you burn your net worth by going into tremendous debt in your teens, you will find your passions are extinguished due to lifelong financial hardship and financial reality. If you strategize correctly, and get the cheapest degree possible in computer science and then study your passions on the side, you will find yourself in a world where the thing you can do for 15 hours a day is read, make open source works, volunteer at a local nonprofit, and do some lifelong learning for free. I don't see how embracing anti-consumerism at a young age doesn't enable a lifetime of learning in whatever pursuit you find interesting. You'll accomplish what you want just by delaying fully pursuing your passions for a decade while you work as a programmer. It's a worthwhile tradeoff for a lifetime of the possibility of work at whatever organization you want in your hometown, regardless of salary concerns. That's freedom. That's why getting a UoPeople CS degree and studying Holm School is a great plan. You might even find that if you study computer science hard enough when you're 18, you can start working in just a few years (I found employment after two years of studying CS). Then just live frugally by finding ways to entertain yourself for free (very very easy through your public library and online public libraries), and you'll be free to do whatever you want in 14 years.

Take my advice, paying for the "best" education in your FAVORITE topic is a recipe for financial disaster. Use your prefrontal cortex and delay your gratification for a decade and then really let your freak flag fly. You probably won't even have to touch computer science ever again if you don't want to. Get the cheapest computer science degree possible but study like you're at Harvard and you'll find success.

## #3 - They Have Mandatory Readings

A few years after I graduated with an art history degree from Reed, I was walking around my public library and went down their art aisle. For whatever reason, I hadn't been to the public library in a while (I was struggling with mental illness primarily after graduating college), and I saw before me two aisles full of huge art books on great artists. There was no dearth, no paltry selection, instead I saw thousands of books on art history that I could work my way through for free. I realized then that I had paid astronomically for a selection of art history books at Reed College which was basically the same, but cost much much more. I felt like a buffoon, some shmuck who got had moving across the nation when everything I needed was available for free in my hometown. I realized I had a lifetime, a master's degree, a phd's degree, worth of educational material in those two massive aisles of books. And here I was unable to pay my loans because of a disability.

As I think back on that day, which is engraved in my mind, I sort of have to laugh. I realize that the irony is that I realized the public library's art history stack was as good as my "elite" private university art book stack. But my focus is not on the similitude, but rather the fact that I never got to read Reed's stack or my public library's art stack. Instead of just browsing the art history stack like I was doing at the public library, I was always on the hook to read the latest assignment or journal article. Sure, I mean, I read books from the stack, some of my favorite memories are just browsing the Reed stacks and getting a good book whenever I found one, but in contemplating my public library I realized I could create a PhD curriculum's worth of material from their resources. I just needed to get to the work of reading the ones I wanted to read. I I could have done the same at Reed, making my own curriculum from their library stacks and leading myself through four years of intensive self-guided learning. Instead I was mandatorily reading journal articles and assigned books and never got any time to read a whole lot of books from the stacks. Here Reed had this wonderful library, but I was so busy doing class assignments that I never got to read whatever I wanted from it.

And that's what I want to emphasize in this blog post -- how corrupt it is that you, in college, are not just let loose in the library stacks and told to read as much as you can in four years, writing whatever books or blogs you want in the process. Instead, you're cordoned off by mandatory labor, reading only the books that are assigned, to such a degree that you have zero spare time for pleasurable/self-guided reading. It's almost as if the university library is for show only, it's just there to convince you that you can learn almost anything, but instead you find yourself learning the narrow curricular objectives of your professors. I view the public library as a magical place, and I suspect that university libraries could be too given the brief moments of happiness I had when I pleasure read books in my university library, but it's a lost cause if you think you're going to benefit from a university library. It's for show only, you never get to touch it. Instead you're reading wacko mandatory pomo journal articles and the books you yourself are on the hook to purchase.

Which is kind of why I reject university learning. I think a person should just be turned loose in a library and be allowed to learn whatever they want. Sure, some curation is necessary, but assigning backbreaking amounts of mandatory reading like what happens in college would make the magic of self-guided learning at the library impossible. And it does. A university presents a library available only to students, but ironically those students don't get to actually USE the library because they're busy being students with their self-bought books.

And that's why a public library, whether online or offline, is probably a better model for education. I think people are completely capable of guiding their own education, especially when presented with the resources needed to self-educate (like adequate books of various skill levels). It's weird that university libraries don't open their stacks to outsiders, perhaps for a subscription fee or something, because they would be concerned that books would be checked out by townies when actual students needed a book. Instead the library just sits collecting dust, unused except for the most fleeting breaks in a work schedule. You're paying for that university library, but you don't get to benefit from that library.

And that's what I want to emphasize, how suspect it is that you're not just told to spend the next four years in your university library and emerge a new person. My belief is that universities understand this practice as a threat to their monetization model. If people were told their best education comes from just spending all their free time reading books that interest them, it is not a far stretch to imagine that they would start doing the same at the public library down the street (which is free). If you could make your own curriculum, then you wouldn't need the rest of the buildings in a university, just the library with some reading rooms. It would look suspiciously like a... public library. Instead, universities have to assign as much mandatory reading as possible, taking up as much physical time of a student as possible without breaking with physical law and child abuse. Some naive students view their efforts at cracking the mandatory curriculum as proof of rigor and value, but actually it just shows that universities are scared to let students loose in their massive libraries, out of fear that students will learn they learn more reading books that interest them than being force-fed wacky pomo journal articles.

Think how suspicious it is that you are required to purchase a textbook for a computer science class. Why can't the professor use free OER so no one is mandated to spend money? Why can't you rely on the books covering that topic available at your university library? Everyone could pick, for example, the operating systems book that interested them in particular and study those, rather than working their way through a mandatory text. Why are the mandatory texts never available in your university library? One would think those would be the first to be purchased for fulfilling student's need. Yet they never are in the stacks, and the only reason I can muster is conspiracy. Instead, universities realize the more they get you to spend on books outside of their library stacks, the less likely you are to discover that you can teach yourself a topic solely using the library stacks. To permit a student to learn using the library would spill the beans, so to speak, that having time to read is a great way to learn. Instead, this farce of constant mandatory reading must be maximized to the greatest extent possible, lest someone have the free time to pick up a book from the stacks and read it out of self interest.

That's why computer science is nearly the only academic subject where you can be successful without a degree. Because so many other computer scientists are self-taught, they released their textbooks as open source to help out other self-taught students. [There is a virtual public library of computer science textbooks](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books). Is there something like this for other departments? Heavens no. Because computer science in particular realizes that a public library can get digitized and distributed to the world for free. A public library can't be distributed across the world for free. A university library can't either. But because computer scientists built the internet, for the sheer purpose of distributing a public library for free across the globe, computer science is the one subject that allows for self-taught students to be admitted into the occupational workforce. Has any other academic department built an internet to distribute their key texts? No. Did art history departments build a network to allow for free reproduction and duplication of art history books across the world instantaneously? Nope, just computer science. And that's why computer science is the sort of philosopher's stone of academia, in which you can get a $4000 UoPeople CS degree and frankly probably find employment in whole lot of other fields too. Because computer scientists know spending a lot of money to get assigned an expensive mandatory curriculum risks wasting your valuable time that could be better spent learning what you need to know to get employed as a computer scientists. The university gig just doesn't make any sense after the invention of the internet and ipads and open source.

You can do some serious academic learning just at your public library. University students and employees will deny this until the cows come home, but don't believe them. Your public library probably can provide free education for your entire lifetime, through job after job and interest after interest. The belief that you have to spend a lot of money for "real" educational resources is baloney, and frankly it wouldn't matter anyway because you never get any time to read those educational resources because you're reading from your assigned textbooks and journal articles. A library never used is a shame to see, but that's what you'll experience if you go to a university. You'll leave never having gotten the chance to even browse the stacks like you did at your public library, but you're left with a tremendous bill for the ability to have a private library like that at your disposal. It's just another way universities justify their massive tuition bill, having this fake library performance that's just for show and regaling naive students into believing they're getting their money's worth.

My guess is, you'd be better off saving your money and just spending four years intensively studying at your public library. I know that kind of certifies me as crazy in America, where universities are basically a religion for some reason, but that's my belief. You're not going to get a better education at the butt end of a professor's stick, with mandatory books that cost a lot and often are just there to keep you busy so you don't actually read what you want to read. Universities are about brain washing students into being loyal alumni who continue to donate after graduating. You aren't loyal to your public library like that. But perhaps you should be. Perhaps you should be loyal to the computer scientists who built a free virtual public library for CS. Perhaps you should be loyal to Archive.org. Because those are the means that will enable a whole lot more people to realize they can get a PhD worth of education for almost zero dollars. And when you can self-educate and self-empower without going into debt, it permits a whole lot of exploration of topics that people can't explore when they're in debt. Like open source. So here's to the open sourcing of university libraries, so that instead of having to be a student, anyone can be permitted to browse their stacks. And actually read their books, without spending all their time on manditory reading.

It's exactly what universities fear.

## #2 - Eighteen Is the Age You Start Self-Educating

My [Hum110](https://ryheimat.github.io/holm-school/jekyll/2021-01-06-Humanities-Curriculum.html) professor's parting advice at the end of the year was to take a year off between undergraduate and graduate school. He said this to a group of students that largely were planning on going on to graduate school. I took his advice the year after I graduated, after I dropped out of Mills's electronic music MFA program. I lived in my hometown, in my sister's upstairs at her home, and went to the law school she was attending's library at night with her and studied Swedish. Suddenly I found myself continuing to self-educate year after year, and though I contemplated enrolling in graduate school, I was doing just fine self-educating without spending dozens of thousands of dollars per year to do it curricularly in a university.

So the gap year my Hum110 professor told us about became a permanent break from graduate school for me. I realized everything I needed to become educated enough to write books was available very cheaply in my hometown, and didn't require tuition or moving to an expensive city and paying rent each month for years on end with no income.

I don't think I've mentioned how Washburn University's Mabee Library, the library for my hometown university, use to have a whole room with just art history books as a small Art History library. I have mentioned how my public library's art/art history stack is an enormous two rows of books on artists and art. Since townies can check out books at Washburn for free through a borrower's card, I figured I could give myself a graduate-degree equivalent education in art history without paying tuition. Unfortunately the library then went through a rennovation, and they got rid of the Art History library. But my guess is all those books that used to be there are available through Archive.org or LibGen. So the loss is not huge. It's not like those books were thrown away (even though they probably were), they just now exist permanently on the internet. Still, I realized if I were ever to get a Master's degree in art history, I should probably get what's available at Washburn (a MALS - Master's of Arts in Liberal Science) degree rather than trekking off to a foreign city to get an art history degree. I could write an art history paper for my MALS degree. So I am covered if I ever decide to try again at Graduate School. But like that gap year taught me, I probably don't need to spend the money to do it. I can just do it on my own in my free time, free of cost.

So this essay in particular is being written to express the point that taking a gap year between undergraduate and graduate school is a very healthful thing to help break the brainwashing that occurs in academia to teach students that academia is the one-true-source of truth and creativity in the world. Spending a little free time outside of this bubble really helps you realize that academia is a bit of a farce, with its high tuition and corrupt student loan process. Books are institutionally agnostic. You can read a book as long as you have access to the book whether or not you're enrolled at a university. And the good news is, books are become much more accessible outside of universities through digital public libraries. Archive.org is like walking into a university library in the 1980s, and even public libraries have reading apps (mine is called "Libby") that has an extensive collection of public domain classics (including audiobooks for when you're commuting) through which to engage with the same literature and art you'd be engaging with at a university.

My gap year was educational enough because I read Anya Kamenetz's ["DIY University"](https://archive.org/details/diyuedupunksedup0000kame), which struck in me a fervor to do my life education outside the realm of paid-for-education. I've reached a happy medium where sometimes I enroll in university briefly and take a light but specifically-focused topical course load if that's what is necessary to get to where I want to be in my studies quickly. Basically I've spent about $10,000 on college education the past 12 years since graduating from college. This is a small amount given how much I've learned since graduating. My key components have been my public library, which has Treehouse and Lynda accounts along with their physical stacks, Washburn's Library which is free for townies, and LibGen and Archive.org. If I were to further pursue computer science education, I would do so through affordable degree programs like UoPeople and GATech's OMSCS graduate degree through my tuition reimbursement program at work. Though it took a while to get here, I now realize that I don't need to spend any money anymore learning what I need to learn. The internet resources are just so extensive that it's redundant and unnecessary to spend any money.

My point is, I think if you were to take a gap year between high school and undergraduate, you would discover the same thing. I didn't discover this until I had graduated and read "DIY University." But I'm sure you could come to the same conclusions even at age 18. And that's what I want to emphasize is different between college and high school. In college, you want to learn what you want to learn. But you don't have any time to surf the university library due to your high course load. They do this so that you don't have any time to read books you actually want to read, because to do so would teach you that you could get as good as an education where ever you could find access to books (i.e. free at your public library). And the truth that you are probably 100% capable of teaching yourself whatever topic you want through free online and in-town resources.

18 is roughly the age at which independence becomes a fundamental aspect of your personality. At age 18, you want to start learning the topics that interest you and aren't forced upon you. Unfortunately you'll find at university, topics are foisted upon you and eat up all your free time. And you're spending a lot of money to learn things you don't want to learn. It's complete inefficiency of your time and money. At age 18, you are finally mature enough to teach yourself how to teach yourself outside of the university system - "unschooling", or my take: "holmschooling." This is infinitely rewarding than being reliable on an expensive, inefficient university system. And I think it is very within reach of even an 18 year old. You can supplement your unschooling with an affordable program like UoPeople that uses OER, but using the Holm School curriculum to learn computer science, for example, will give you employable skills and zero debt. Since not having debt when you're young and employed can be [invested in index funds](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) for compounding gains of [64x your principal during 40+ years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGeFiplIw5s&feature=emb_title), being employed with zero debt as a computer scientist will likely result in early financial independence and much more freedom for you to pursue what you want to do in life. Why wait until you've graduated to take a gap year and figure this out yourself? All it takes is a break from the rigmarole of academia to break the bubble vision and see the scam behind the industry. Why wait until you're 22 and a hundred thousand dollars in debt? Do it when you're 18 and plan for a means of self-educating yourself as cheaply as possible to enable investing as much as possible in index funds when you're as young as possible. The cheaper your education, the more you can invest when employed at 22, and the more you can invest at 22, the more your early money can compound to reach the point that you're financially independent. This strategy isn't intuitive, it takes a little research, but that research is completely free and open source and catalogged at the Holm School website. Even if you're 18, you can strategize an academic study plan that results in zero debt (i.e. just getting a UoPeople degree that you can pay off working 3 hours a week minimum wage for four years).

I was playing around on my Libby app yesterday (this is my public library's digital book app where I can check out and read books and audiobooks), and there was a list of roughly 400 classic books. Books that I read in college and would read in graduate school. And here they were for free, on-demand on my ipad, with no checkout limits or waitlists because they're public domain. I used to pay $0.25 at my public library's Booktique to buy used Penguin books, but now they were completely free through Libby. Obviously since they were public domain, they were also available at Project Gutenberg, but at least Libby had a nice interface with color book covers and was very quick to checkout and begin reading. In the "always-available" classics section, there was basically my four-years of humanities curricula available for free. The same humanities curricula I paid a whole lot of money to read at university just a decade before. Now it was free on my ipad.

My point is that self-education becomes more and more feasible every day with the invention of new, free Educational Technology. As books are digitized and put online through Controlled Digital Lending, there will be a cornucopia of reading materials through which anyone can get the same university education with zero cost. It's a great future, and what I'm writing about right now in Holm School as a bit fringe ideology will probably be mainstream in 15 years. So I'm going to keep with Holm School and keep building curricula using CDL and OER so that people learn how to teach themselves for free.

Take a gap year to discover yourself. Don't wait until you're 22 and a hundred thousand dollars in debt from undergraduate. Do it at 18 and spend the year self-educating at your public library and online at Holm School, etc. You'll realize you can take a permanent break from academia, rather than buying into the belief system that you MUST BE A PROFESSOR AT ANY AND ALL COSTS. Being a professor would be cool, but being financially independent at age 30 is probably cooler. And what's the difference if you still learn the things you wanted to learn at age 30 on the financial independence path? On the professor path, you'll have postmodernism, literary theory, and anti-humanism as the assigned reading material in all your undergraduate and graduate classes. While it's good to get different points of view, I say: Cut the fat, learn to program for free through online material and your public library, then become financially independent in your thirties and spend the rest of your life doing and studying whatever in god's name you want. That's to me the "professorial" life, not slaving away in academia for 12 years at the cost of many hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

So for one rule, let me confirm my Hum110's professor's sage advice: Take a gap year between undergraduate and graduate school. Then let me modify and confirm my Holm School advice: Take a gap year between high school and undergraduate school. You should probably learn to program (for free, here on Holm School and elsewhere on Github). This will teach you everything you need to know in regards to becoming a mini professor at the school of lifelong learning. When you are forced to rely on your hometown resources for education for a year, you quickly become adept at using and discovering what's available for free in your hometown. These skills replace the need for university, and in a way pay for themselves. All it takes is a short break in the pipeline of academia. For just living independenly of academia for one year, you can teach yourself how to self-educate for free in your hometown. Once you are skilled in this manner, the opportunity supposed by academia pales in comparison to the unschooling skills you just acquired. It becomes vastly sillier to spend money to learn when you already know how to learn for free. And so, academia fades away from being relevant in your life, and you can continue living as a happy unschooler with zero debt but a good job and ample free time to pursue your academic interests. This is the happy medium that is bestowed when you self-educate yourself to be able to self-educate. This education, in education, is more important than anything you learn in university. In fact, universities purposefully obfuscate this life lesson in order for you to be reliant on suckling the teet of university's proprietary education at great expense to you for as long as they can possibly get away with. You won't learn to learn through your university library, or reading supplemental books from the city's public library. Everything will be THIS ASSIGNED READING, THAT ASSIGNED READING, FROM ACADEMIC JOURNALS ACCESSIBLE ONLY THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY INTRANET instead of free books available on the internet or at the public library. A free book is meaningless to a university, it must be derided and mocked and minimized. Even though a free (open source) book is the life blood of unschooling, it is virtually ignored by universities. The two means of knowledge production -- the university and the public library -- are so different in nature as to be utterly competitive models of education. After exploring both realms during my life, I have come to the firm side of public libraries instead. This is the fringe belief at the moment, but in the future I believe it will be the dominant model of education in America. I am just early, and I hope anyone who participates in my website will reap the benefits of being early on a radical transformation. Public libraries have won the competition, and now it is just up to open source authors to educate the world about OER and CDL.

Training yourself to be a productive researcher through just your public library and online resources will enable you to create work while spending virtually nothing on up front costs. Many people this type of research and cultural production can't be done, that you have to spend money at university to have the proper resources, but that's not true anymore in 2020. By using the resources cataloged here, you can fuel productive output for the rest of your life at zero cost. The day and age of paying for more than a couple hundreds of dollars per year for education are over. Education has been solved by EdTech and digital public libraries. Reap what they harvest and you'll have the skills to be a successful employee with zero debt and financial obligations. To ignore these resources, which many people don't know about simply because they are so new, would be a great mistake. If you don't already know how to use these resources, like Github and Archive.org and OER, CDL, OCW, digital public libraries, free books, then my suggestion is to take a gap year and learn how to use these things effectively. This is the kind of study skills that will pay for themselves. It is very important not to waste your time and money pursuing other means of education when this path is so ripe with resources but only takes a small learning curve. I suggest taking a gap year as soon as possible. You probably won't ever go back to academia. You'll probably find a job and start saving up money while using your tuition reimbursement to get more computer science degrees. Really, the possibilities are immense once you declare independence from academia. Might I suggest you make sure you deeply understand open source educational resources before paying one more dollar to a university.

## #1 - Purchase Academia's Factory Seconds

I like Fred Perry shirts. Unfortunately, Fred Perry shirts these days are around $100 new. That is frankly crazy, so I own one Fred Perry shirt. Sure, it's my favorite shirt, but do I feel any desire to add more to my collection when they're so expensive? No, I can do without. I can purchase cheaper Lacoste or Ben Sherman shirts. I can go to the Salvation Army in Latham, NY and get 30 Polo polos for $4 each. My closet is 95% shirts from the Salvation Army in Latham, and 5% Lacoste, Ben Sherman, and Fred Perry.

One interesting fact I learned the past year is that someone is selling factory rejects of Fred Perry shirts on ebay for around $15 direct from the Hong Kong factory. Unfortunately I should have bought some when they were being sold, because I noticed today they're not on sale anymore. Nevertheless, the point of this post isn't to wax and wane of the economics of Fred Perry secondary markets, but to wax and wane on the economics of academia secondary markets.

Here's a simple truth: Some textbooks will be duds. This, for example, is exactly the state of my website. I think the content is great, it's a robust curriculum that proves it point many times over that there are plenty of free CS books out there to learn CS topics for free. I belabor that point by listing like 15 free textbooks for each CS Topic - More than any single person could ever hope to read in a lifetime. My point isn't to try and get someone to read 15 Discrete Mathematics books, but to prove that there is more educational content than you can literally consume and fit into your life. And all of it is free. To pay for a university degree when you could study OER for 15 years nonstop is frankly ridiculous, especially when you include externalities like Library Genesis in there. Yet, for all the value I think my website provides, it is an EdTech dud. I get roughly one hit a day? On a good day? I realize there are already open source curricula for computer science, but I am shocked by how little need there apparently is for a secondary or tertiary open source programming curricula. Since there's no money in open source, let alone an unsuccessful open source project, this website's "valuation" as it stands economically is about $0.25. The price I used to pay for a used Penguin Classic book at my public library's Booktique in high school.

But this is not to wax and wane about the economics of Holm School. It is instead of profess to you the beauty of purchasing academic factory seconds instead of actual academic market goods. There is great benefit in buying factory second clothing, but there's even greater benefit in buying factory second academic material. That's because a shirt can't be digitized until they invent some kind of shirt 3D printer, but any academic material can be. It can be scanned or dumped into a pdf and hosted on the internet for free. So instead of "Shipping the factory second from direct in Hong Kong," the academic factory second is shipped to you at roughly the energy-consumption equivalent of being paid for by a quick ad banner on the web page, or something equivalent. Factory seconds in academia are basically free, because what use is open source licensing for something that can't be easily duplicated? The funny part is, roughly all of academia's teaching materials (except socratic seminars) can be digitized and duplicated and replicated as the click of a mouse for the entirity of the future of civilization. Open source license a factory second and you're generating a textbook that can be used an infinite times by an infinite amount of people with zero production cost, other than time spent making it initially on the computer. And fortunately, most computer scientist who write textbooks are paid professors. They have the security to write a dud academic text and still receive a paycheck for their labor, even without any future royalty payments based on sales. This sort of flexibility for CS authors, when combined with the fact that the internet is a product of computer science research, with ADDITIONAL consideration that computer scientists are paid well in general, permitting business or economic failures that aren't permanently disabling, enabling experimentation. And computer science authors have decided part of this experimentation with authorship is to release their dud textbooks with an open source license when it fails to gain traction in curricula across the world or generate revenue.

Open sourcing your dud textbook isn't a mystery that needs explaining to most computer scientists. What's the point of "digitally hoarding" a creation behind copyright law that isn't returning any revenue? The entire point of making academic texts is to generate a profit for yourself using traditional copyright. What's the point of maintaining copyright status for a work that doesn't return any revenue? So the logical next step is to release the dud textbook into the public domain for the benefit of humanity. I don't need to emphasize that computer scientists usually operate on humanistic principals of benefitting humanity. That's roughly the purpose of science. So computer scientists don't take much convincing to see their academic text have an "after life" in the factory seconds/open source market. Many would rather have their labor at least be used and studied, even without profit, than have their work linger as just another orphaned work under copyright for 70 years after their death, read by no one since it's out of print and digitizing [the book is apparently enough to get you sued even if you keep a 1:1 physical:digital copy.](https://blog.archive.org/2020/06/01/four-commercial-publishers-filed-a-complaint-about-the-internet-archives-lending-of-digitized-books/) Copyright can keep a work from being read at all. Many authors would rather their book be read by no one than be read but generate no profit for themselves. Those people are kind of duds themselves. Fortunately computer scientists aren't completely driven by money alone, since they usually already have enough anyway or are financially secure in a computer science job. So they open source their dud textbook.

I have mentioned previously the benefit of open sourcing books. It basically operates on the "Don't Repeat Yourself" ethos. You only need a few open source textbooks lingering online to have the benefit of covering a topic completely but requiring zero money. We don't need thousands of people creating open source resources, just a few per topic, enough to cover the basics to cover a college-equivalent understanding, with more advanced topics simply being icing on the cake. So while there are thousands of for-money textbooks on every computer science topic, there are only about 5-10 OER books on each topic. Many people might hold this against OER as an engineering practice, to suggest that it implies there is no reward for creating OER so no one is incentivized to make OER, as proof of the small numbers of OER texts. But they are failing to understand that D.R.Y. applies here, and the small amount of OER compared to proprietary resources just proves that open source is the most efficient form of education in the modern world. We don't need people repeating the labor that other people have already done. You can just remix or reuse the existing material and append to it anything you feel needs appending, then release it back into the public domain. We don't need hundreds of authors for hundreds of books, we need hundreds of part-time maintainers for a single book. Hence why Holm School is a dud, because it's not D.R.Y. How many open source curricula does the world need?

So academia's "factory seconds" have the benefit that they're digital instead of physical and reproducible/duplicable and released under an open source license. Factory seconds have defects, OER have creative common licenses. They are both "duds" in the economic sense. But the effect is, though, and this is somewhat magical, that you get a pretty good product for vastly cheaper than you would in the store or shop. And trust me, academia is just a shop attempting to sell you wares and ideologies in the form of books and lectures. There are profit-generating assets but also immense liabilities from material overhead. On the other hand, open source generates no profit but has no liabilities either. It is marginally neutral for the future entirity of civilization (rather than waiting 70 years after the death of the author to do the same). There is no money generated or taken by open source. Sure, there's labor, but not all labor generates profit in a capitalist economy organized by mutually exclusive competition for dollars. Fortunately, open source is not mutually exclusive, the fact that it's digital and public domain allows for a non-zero-sum transaction in every realm where open source can be applied - music, art, writing, books, teaching, designs, 3D prints, engineering, etc. Moving away from a zero-sum game is what allows computer scientists to contribute to their own livelihood and success by open sourcing a textbook that could teach a pupil how to program so effectively for free that they go on to create a business that employs that more experienced computer scientist. It's [generative, not extractative](https://www.wbez.org/stories/ethnomathematician-ron-eglash-indigenous-knowledge-dismantles-white-supremacy/43485dac-eda6-46f6-af58-a2e08cc3d84f). Generative capitalism is what builds a public domain that sustains civilization in the most harm-neutral way for the longest possible time. Extractative capitalism builds prorprietary domains that extract as much money from civilization without regards to societal harms or impact. Open source is generative, and since computer science and science in general tends to be generative regarding making new jobs through new technologies, learning to program is easily done for free through open source educational resources. It's a positive feedback loop in which creating open source computer science content generates more open source computer science content which allows more open source computer science content to be created, since everything is so affordable and headache free.

Factory seconds academic textbooks have failed at extracting money from a market. But they can be resurrected as generative just by open sourcing them and making the labor behind their production be admired as craft. And computer scientists willing and gladly do this, because they recognize the craft behind their productions is more meaningful than the market efficiencies behind them. That is why I feel computer science is such an interesting and inspiring field compared to some of the other disciplines I've studied and worked in. Nothing is as exciting as seeing [hundreds of open source computer science textbooks](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) waiting for you to read them in a free digital library hosted on Github. When you've lived a life paying overdraft charges buying books for your classes. It just makes sense, and is awe-inducing. It doesn't leave you feeling exploited and abused, poorer instead of wealthier. If psychologically is any indication, wearing a factory second won't even be noticed by your peers and hence is psychologically the equivalent of wearing the primary market shirt. Having learned to program using OER won't even be noticed by your peers either. Factory seconds are a great way to participate in culture without being on the hook financially for entry into that culture through the most expensive gateway possible. Anyone who polices a culture to enforce the primary market for source material only is a sell out. If companies are selling factory seconds, you might as well purchase them! You can always choose to return to the main store if you're left disappointed. But I doubt you will be. The open source computer science community is awesome, and it's a great "alumni" network to belong to even if you don't get a fancy alumni magazine in the mail every quarter. The internet is one big free digital college, and only you can decide whether you want to enroll and be a student or not. If you can get over the psychological hiccup of not having any prestige tied to your degree, you can truly thrive as a student. Just read the manual and you'll be set up for a lifetime of learning at no cost. I bet your friends and coworkers can't even tell you're wearing a factory second.
