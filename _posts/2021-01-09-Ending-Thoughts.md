## The Teenage Liberation Handbook


The name "Holm School" is an obvious pun about how I'm promoting home schooling when it comes to computer science at the college level. Let me explain the gestation behind my theory, and let me remind you, that this is _not_ what I did myself, so be critical of everything I suggest: I studied at a local public college for two years and moonlighted at Treehouse and that was sufficient to start my programming career, not to mention I had a liberal arts B.A. But concurrent with my enrollment in college to study computer science I began reading about unschooling. My favorite reading from this period was Grace Llewellyn's The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education (1998). The book makes a plea for unschooling: home schooling without all the sticky stigma of Christian fundamentalism. My second favorite book I read during this time was the blog "100 Reasons not to go to graduate school" (http://100rsns.blogspot.com/) which I came across as a result of reading William Panneckar (["Graduate School in the Humanities: Just Don't Go"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the/44846), ["Just Don't Go, Part 2"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Just-Dont-Go-Part-2/44786?cid=rclink), ["The Big Lie About the 'Life of the Mind'"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Big-Lie-About-the-Life-of/63937?cid=rclink)). The general gist of unschooling and the dismal outlook on graduate school for the humanities cemented my decision to abandon anything related to the university as it most likely had nothing to offer a computer scientist at an affordable price. I wrapped up the classes I was enrolled in and after two years in the CS department called it quits and started studying at home. Fortunately it turned out those two years of study were enough to get me a job, so I never had the opportunity to unschool. But I believe that it would have been a frugal choice given the fact that even the local college in my town was $1000 a class. I don't believe you need a bachelor's degree in computer science when your public library offers Treehouse and Lynda for self-study, and you can learn web development and build a resume/portfolio for free. When you benefit so much from your public library (and honestly my public university's classes were especially helpful too-- they motivated me to study extra hard to the point when I was a semester ahead in our java textbook after three months) you begin to realize that the future of computer science education is online, and not in expensive universities. I don't need a bachelor's in CS because I don't intend to get a PhD in CS. A PhD would help me get a job teaching at a uni, and those are just about the only benefit for 4-7 years of hard work. If I really wanted to teach, I wouldn't teach at a uni, I would teach somewhere online.

What's the point of teaching at a place that causes non-forgivable student debt and massive risk to the student? That's because online study can optimally be free through your public library. The aim of unschooling is to be extremely frugal, and I am an unschooling advocate. I'd rather work at a nonprofit that exploits modern internet technology to increase its educational reach for free, a la Khan Academy. If you don't know that much about unschooling, I highly suggest you read Llewellyn's book. Its target audience is youth, but its advice about how to implement your own education is priceless. Unschooling isn't easy, but the internet makes it much easier, and studying unschooling will help you be successful in the immediate now but also for the extended future. OER didn't exist back when Llewellyn wrote Teenage Liberation Handbook, but incorporating those into the unschooling curriculum helps immensely in making it affordable. Everything being invented as Open Education is complementary to unschooling, it's almost as if they are the same thing: OER is made for unschooling. It'd be a shame to not agree with this observation and continue to pay tuition just as an insurance or emergency plan b. Obviously do so if you've found cheap tuition at a public university. But most likely you won't find that, because it is going extinct. You must modify your plan of attack and use cheap online education as a plan c, such as University of the People. It's unfortunate but if you're well read about unschooling you might even get excited about online learning. As a computer scientist, you will be on your computer when you learn anyway, so you might as well splitscreen your text editor with an OER PDF or a Lynda video. A lot of online learning gets a bad rap because people don't want to be on their computer any more than they have to. But you have to be on a computer to input your code in an editor, so the complaint is moot. This is like a fundamental law of computer science education. You're forced to be on your computer to study, so why not study using a computer-based source such as OER or your public library video library instead of an expensive textbook?

Another question is whether inexpensive online schooling is coterminous with unschooling, and I would promote that it is. UoPeople is a great way to score a bachelor's degree in computer science for very low costs, and I think the independence that is required to succeed at online schooling is the same as the self-motivation needed to succeed at unschooling. The question is whether you are going to go above and beyond the minimum requirement for the assignment and continue to study extra OER when you are done and still have hours in the day left. To succeed in CS you need to work on it everyday, all day, for four years. Fortunately there are a ton of free open education resources for computer scientists, and I highly recommend you work ahead in your studies instead of stopping your studying when you are done with the assignment. Reading ahead in the book and completing problem sets from future chapters is a great way to certify that you are going to pass your classes with flying colors. The quicker you get done with the rudimentary stuff, the faster you can move on to the difficult subjects in which, if you master while you are unemployed and have the free time to study, you can find employment. Unschooling to me means that you study outside of your homework, that you find learning almost like a hobby and treat it as an occupation that fills your free time from when you wake up to when you go to sleep. Being a little obsessive about learning CS before your first job ensures that when you do find employment, you will be advanced enough in your skills to contribute to the team. I find unschooling allows you to break away from the concept of homework and, in the beneficial circumstance you find yourself with free time after completing your homework, provides the motivation to keep your studying more advanced topics (and finish reading a book before you're supposed to) in order to keep your progress as fast as possible. Wanting to learn computer science should be all the drive necessary to keep you unschooling CS as fast as possible. In fact, unschooling is a good after-work hobby for when you've completed your homework, but want to study a second language or learn a new framework with the current language you're studying. You can keep unschooling separate from your class/homework time, but at the point in which your obsessive drive to unschool in CS pays off by making you a master of your homework because you're so much more advanced than the minimum expectations for a student at that point in the semester, you'll truly see how unschooling benefits traditional schooling. UoPeople is a good experiment if you are interested in unschooling after reading Llewellyn's book. It's a good way to implement unschooling while still ultimately getting the reward of a degree, even if it's not regionally accredited.

I want to emphasize that in promoting unschooling, I am not saying that college is uncool. If you get a scholarship to go to a university somewhere for dirt cheap, you should go. But college is really expensive, and if you want to be frugal and not go in debt, then unschooling is a good mindset to adopt. In some sense computer science is the same everywhere, there isn't much derivation in course material between public universities and private universities (just in work load), so if you find a cheap public university you can make a really frugal choice to study at public school (perhaps even on scholarship) and still come out a competent computer scientist. But a lot of computer science is also self-study. You aren't going to learn JavaScript at university. You aren't going to learn full stack. So if you are interested in those topics you'll have to self-study in your free time. I want to remind you that it is my prediction that, in the future, you will be able to go to online college and get a accredited bachelor's degree for free through your local public library. But that is not the case at the moment, which makes getting a degree for cheap through a public university or community college a really sensible and frugal choice. The meta-phenomenon of this future prediction is cheap online learning sites like Treehouse and cheap online degrees like UoPeople that compete for cheap prices. In time these will merge with your public library to provide accredited computer science degrees for free. This should make you much more confident in choosing unschooling. People will mention what public library they studied at in their future resumes. If you take the approach, that I promote, to study CS extensively through your public library, you will find that the resources to learn CS are free. If you trust me that public libraries will provide free computer science online degrees in the future, if you can't afford public university (for example, there isn't a college in your hometown and paying for rent to live in a different city to attend is too daunting), then online learning/open education concomitant with full-throttled use of your public library is a very safe bet for getting what you're after as a computer scientist. If you approach life-long learning as others approach unschooling, you will see the benefit of being frugal early in your life and avoiding going into debt for student loans. You will see that online learning of computer science (and only computer science, this isn't true for other disciplines) is a very legitimate source of self-education. Given the extent of free OpenCourseWare video playlists and OER, you can learn CS for free, and employers are just going to have to deal with it if they want to hire programmers. The ball is in your court as a self-educating online learner, that is to say. Expensive colleges do not have the upper hand in this battle of private schools versus public libraries. Public libraries will expand their educational offerings and scope in combination with new and improved OER, and soon you might even wind up with a CS degree paid for by your public library. This reality will cause a paradigm shift in hiring practices by companies. The question is, do you wait it out, or do you act as an early adopter and start learning exclusively at the public library now? That is a choice only you can make, but by reading books like The Teenage Liberation Handbook, perhaps you can discover the happiness that awaits self-education outside the confines of student debt and loans and tuition.


## Tips for Personal Finance

I wrote this for my team wiki's "Quality of Life" topic, and I thought I'd cross post it here. Enjoy:

Since Tegan reorganized our wiki yesterday and we now have a “Quality of Life Tips” category, I want to share with the team what I’ve learned in the past year studying Personal Finance and how that relates to working in a tech career, especially a job in the FinTech industry. If you agree with the ideas, the principles can maybe help guide you as a FinTech employee and perhaps steer our development of new products and services. I think having a strong grasp of Personal Finance is important if you work in the FinTech industry because if you are a master of your personal finances you have an omni-level understanding of what is necessary in order to generate wealth for yourself. If you take what you learn in knowing how to generate personal wealth, then you can package that up into products which meet the goals of our customers, which is also to generate personal wealth for themselves. Personal finance is a hard subject, I’m not going to lie, and even the smartest of developers can make mistakes in the personal finance realm which stalls their retirement or affects their quality of life. Basically it’s kind of like homework, you just gotta get out there and read books. I find studying Personal Finance to be fascinating, however, and have taken to it like an acolyte. I’m usually reading a book about index funds or financial independence on the weekend (John Bogle has like 10 books I’m trying to get through and I’m nearly done reading every book on r/financialindependence’s reading list at https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/books).  I need to get back to studying programming on the weekends, haha. I hope I can share with you in this blog post ideas for your own study and use. 

### tl;dr
Buy a total stock market index fund and total bond market index fund as much as you can and as frequently as you can by maxing out your pre-tax 401K, IRA, and HSA contributions, and put any leftover savings in a post-tax investment account. Buy and hold forever. Vanguard indexes are cheapest. Fund performance is linked to the inexpensiveness of its expense ratio over many decades. Increase your savings rate as high as possible (50%+) while still young to earn compound growth for decades more than usual and push forward your retirement date. Since it’s easier to control your savings rate than it is your market return rate, frugality goes a long way to growing your investments. Cut costs and earn more.

### The Basics: Index Funds
I’m going to start off by talking about index funds. People might have heard about them and seen them on their 401K selection list, but I myself up until last year didn’t realize how important they are as a bedrock for someone’s personal finance. The way they work is this: Instead of relying on a mutual fund manager (who picks stocks, buys and sells holdings, and follows the market), an index fund relies on computers to decide which stocks to buy and sell. The index is basically a cut off point for purchasing: If a stock falls below a certain threshold for value (i.e. its value falls to nothing), the computer indicates that the index fund should sell the stock and not purchase any more of that stock. If a stock’s value rises above that threshold (i.e. it goes from nothing to having value), it is purchased by the index fund. This can be completely automated by computer, at which point a mutual fund manager’s “expertise” in choosing stocks isn’t required and as a result doesn’t have to be paid for. Paying for a mutual fund manager’s expertise is expensive, and its costs are shuffled downwards to the mutual fund purchasers in the form of high expense ratios. Since an index fund is automated, there is no cost which is paid for by the purchasers. So, index funds can have an expense ratio in the hundredths of a percent, while actively managed mutual funds have expense ratios tens of times higher. For example, on our 401K the Vanguard S&P500 index offered on our plan has an expense ratio of 0.04%, while the other actively managed mutual funds have expense ratios of 0.7% or higher.

That might seem negligible, after all what is the difference between 0.04% and 0.7% in terms of the amount of money invested in your 401K? But the way expense ratios work is deceptively not innocuous. The expense ratio comes off from your earning. Let’s say the stock market returns 7% for a year. An e/r of 1% would only return a growth of 6%, while an index fund would return 6.96% for the year. In terms of compound interest, this is a huge difference. When 1% e/r is compounded for thirty years, that 1% e/r turns out siphoning off earnings of hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you had invested in an index fund, you would have hundreds of thousands of dollars more in your retirement account.

For visualizations about how high expense ratios cut into your earnings, check out this hour-long Frontline called “The Retirement Gamble”: https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-retirement-gamble/ If you’re new to what an index fund is, it is a very valuable episode. It also features Jack Bogle, who is a very cool dude who invented the first index fund (based on the S&P 500) in 1976.

Now, you might object to the fact that that higher expense ratio bites into your earnings by arguing that actively managed mutual funds earn more than passively managed mutual funds. While that is sometimes true, it turns out to be the exception rather than the rule in regards to actively managed funds outperforming the market. The S&P500, for example, buys stock in the largest 500 stocks in the market. VTSAX, Vanguard’s total stock market index fund (or any total stock market index fund), for example, buys every stock in the market above a certain value threshold and attempts to hold every stock publically traded. These broad-based holdings of stocks in index funds results in the index fund basically tracking the performance of the market: The earnings of the market are essentially the earnings of the index fund. Actively managed funds’ single goal is to outperform the market: that’s the premium for which you are paying a higher expense ratio. But most actively managed mutual funds don’t outperform the index: roughly 75% of actively managed mutual funds don’t outperform the index. The problem with using actively managed mutual funds for your retirement strategy is the difficulty in choosing the winner versus choosing the loser: sometimes it is just pure luck. Even those that outperform the index usually don’t do so by a vast amount, and the higher expense ratios bite into the earnings. It’s also nearly impossible for a successful actively managed mutual fund to keep up that performance for the long-term (and remember, the goal of investing is to hold mutual funds for 30+ years so you can benefit from compound earnings). When you look at actively managed mutual funds for the long term rather than year by year, most don’t outperform the index. In fact, when you factor in costs and higher taxes for active trading, they underperform the index. Even those that have good years among that 30 year timeline. It’s very difficult to outperform the market for any long term amount. People still hope that their mutual fund manager will, however, and so as a result invest actively instead of passively. Even though if they had invested in an index fund instead, they would have higher earnings at the end of the thirty years. Sometimes this difference can be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Here are some common index funds:

Total Stock Market Index – ex: Vanguard VTSAX, Fidelity FSKAX. Holds every stock in the market. Low expense ratio and also covers some small and mid cap as opposed an S&P500 index which is just large cap. Ultimately the difference in earnings between a total stock market index and a S&P500 index is negligible over thirty+ years.
S&P500 index – ex: Vanguard VFIAX, Fidelity FXAIX. Usually every 401k offers such an index fund, but unfortunately sometimes it’s the only one offered. If your plan also offers a mid and small cap index fund (we do), you can simulate a total stock market fund by buying 81% large cap, 6% mid cap, and 13% small cap. A good expense ratio is 0.04% like ours is, a bad expense ratio is 0.5%+. A S&P500 index covers about 75% of the total stock market, whereas a total stock market index covers 100% (but those small cap companies have smaller returns, so the difference over thirty+ years between VTSAX and VFIAX becomes negligible).

This is all a summary of what I’ve learned regarding index funds, but you can read primary sources re: the outperformance of passive investing versus active investing in Jack Bogle’s “Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns” (2017, audiobook of 2007 edition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNvbBvzelCY ). A good, quick Planet Money episode is “Brilliant vs. Boring,” which discusses Warren Buffet’s 10-year $1 million bet that VFIAX (Vanguard S&P500 Index) would outperform any active hedge fund manager: https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/01/23/688018907/episode-688-brilliant-vs-boring A short podcast series on index funds is NPR LifeKit’s “Secrets of Saving And Investing” (https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510330/secrets-of-saving-and-investing)

So the conclusion many have come to is that index funds are the best investment vehicle for your retirement. After factoring in costs, they outperform actively managed mutual funds due to their low costs and broad holdings which track the market as a whole. It’s somewhat unintuitive that a computer-controlled index can outperform the wisest in the investment industry, but the history of the past forty years points to a clear winner: buy and hold the entire stock market instead of individual stocks. The three factors that determine how much you earn in your investing are: 1) how much you invest 2) the length of time you invest and 3) your returns/earnings. Most people chase the third element, paying more and more for each additional percentage instead of just investing in a total stock market index fund, when it could be that the easiest factor to adjust is the first one, by living frugally and saving as much as you can each and every year, or else the second one, by maxing out your 401K/IRA as soon as you enter the workforce at age 22 and sustaining that for as long as possible until you meet your retirement goals. I’ll talk more about these two factors in the next section.

### How to Retire?
I have been tracking a personal finance strategy the past year called “financial independence” since learning about it two years ago. The jist of it is to try to reduce cost of living as much as possible by living frugally, and to invest your saved money heavily into your retirement at a young age in order to benefit from compound interest for as many decades as possible. The rule of 72 says that the number of years to double your investment is 72 divided by your earnings. A stock market return of 8%, for example, would result in the doubling of your money every 9 years. This means that if you have 9 more years of time to earn compound interest by investing early in your retirement in your career, starting the decade earlier potentially could double your final retirement amount versus if you had waited a decade to start saving for retirement. Financial independence is the point in your life when your savings earn enough money in a year to pay for your cost of living. The main strategy behind this goal is to minimize cost of living while maximizing your saving rate, aiming for something above 50% if not more. Obviously the lower the cost of your yearly living expenses, the less you will have to have saved in mutual funds for their earnings to cover your expenses and the earlier you can stop working if you so choose.

Say you live frugally and max out your 401K and traditional IRA from the age you started working, 22. Doing this for a decade would result in you having $250,000 in your retirement by the age of 32 (maximum contribution for a 401K is $19000 a year, and an IRA is $6000). That is basically enough money for a comfortable retirement already. Since you can’t withdrawl your retirement until you’re 59.5 years old, that $250,000 will compound tax-free for 30 years, resulting in a final amount of $1.9 million assuming a 7% market return. Another important notion in financial independence is the 4% rule: that a safe withdrawl rate at retirement is 4% in order to protect your nest egg for many decades (https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/) Ignoring the details of the 4% rule for the moment, a $1.9 million retirement at 4% withdrawl would allow for a yearly income of $76,000 a year. That’s a hearty sum-- although you have to plan for inflation after 30 years-- but all you did was max out your 401K and IRA for a decade when you started working, which is very feasible. At age 32, you were basically done investing in your retirement and could put all the rest of your earnings from age 32 on in other non-age-linked investment vehicles. That’s why financial independence is usually combined with the notion of early retirement into the acronym FIRE (financial independence, early retirement). If you maxed out your 401K and IRA from ages 22-32 and continued to invest in index funds in an “after tax account” (as opposed to a pre-tax account like the 401K and IRA) from age 22 on, you could basically reach the point where you are earning enough in your post-tax investment account by age 40 or so that you could live off the returns of your post-tax account up until you reach age 60, when you can dip into your 401K and IRA. So you could retire at 40. Obviously this is an extreme goal and not everyone desires early retirement, but I’m just offering it up as an example of what’s possible if you start saving a high percentage of your salary at a young age by living frugally and investing in index funds in your pre- and post-tax accounts. In summary, “FIRE” is a retirement strategy that involves extreme levels of saving at an early age in your working career that enables you to become financially independent as soon as possible so that you can retire at will. You can research more about this on the internet if this sounds interesting to you. A good blog concerning it and outlining strategies for living frugally and saving high is http://mrmoneymustache.com.

So, the “order of operations” for financial independence is something like this:

First, pay off all debt. Getting rid of interest rates on debt is the same as earning the equivalent interest rate in the stock market. A good book on getting out of debt is Dave Ramsey’s Total Money Makeover, or Jerrold Mundis’s How to Get Out of Debt, Stay Out of Debt, and Live Prosperously. A quick audio podcast is NPR’s LifeKit: Get Out of Debt (https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510335/get-out-of-debt)

Second, save up an emergency fund. A emergency fund is a highly liquid account (i.e. a bank account or money market mutual fund) which you can easily convert into cash for an emergency, car wreck/trouble, or medical expenses. A safe amount is usually six month’s worth of expenses.

Next, maximize your 401k each year. The limit on 401K contribution is currently $19,000 a year. 401Ks are pre-tax, so they lower your adjusted marginal tax rate and let you pay lower taxes on your salary. Basically America wants you to have a successful retirement, so there are tax incentives for people who contribute to their retirement. Invest in index funds, and our 401K has some really awesome offerings like S&P500 (large cap), mid-cap index fund, and small-cap index fund. While a S&P500 is usually enough if you aren’t offered a total stock market index fund (returns are similar over the course of 30 years), you can mimic the composition of a total stock market index fund by investing 81% large cap (S&P500 index), 6% mid cap index, and 13% small cap index (source: https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/02/stocks-part-xvii-what-if-you-cant-buy-vtsax-or-even-vanguard/) This is what I’m currently doing on my 401k, and the expense ratio of each of those index is an amazing 0.04-0.05% each. Amazing, thank you. The S&P500 index at my former employer was 0.3 e/r. No bueno.

Next, maximize your IRA. The limit on IRA contributions are currently $6,000 a year. IRAs are pre-tax, so you take off your contribution from your salary each year on your taxes. This again lowers your marginal tax rate, for further benefit. Because you can choose where you set up your IRA, you have the advantage of having more choice in the mutual funds you have at your disposal than with an employer’s 401k, where the mutual funds are preselected. Vanguard is the obvious choice for investing in index funds, since if you have your IRA set up at Vanguard you can invest in the awesome VTSAX total stock market index. Vanguard has the lowest expense ratios of any company in America, because the company was formed to be mutually owned by the actual investors as opposed to beholden to public or private ownership. So decisions are made with the investors in mind. IRAs come in two forms: traditional and Roth. A traditional IRA is pre-tax, with the responsibility of paying taxes upon withdrawl at age 59.5+. Roth IRA are post-tax, and you don’t have to pay taxes upon withdrawing at age 59.5+. While this sounds good, you are essentially limiting your investment by your marginal tax rate (i.e. you pay 15% taxes on your Roth’s $6,000 each year, so you are basically only investing $5100 a year). I go with a traditional IRA but Roth’s are fine, I just expect to have a low tax rate at retirement since I won’t be living the high life then (not that I live the high life now, except in spirit).

Next, maximize your HSA. Your HSA is an investment vehicle if you have a high deductible health plan. I don’t have one and never will, so I’m not totally familiar with HSAs, but you can invest something like $3500 a year pre-tax. If you don’t have medical expenses, which is the goal with a high deductible plan afterall, you basically have a third investment vehicle at your disposal where you can invest in index funds.

Finally, set up a post-tax investment account. The other “buckets” mentioned above are all pre-tax. A post-tax account requires you not only to invest post-tax dollars, but earnings are also taxed. While this sounds bad, it’s really not that bad. Our investment strategy is to buy and hold index funds forever and live off the earnings when we retire (instead of reinvesting them to earn compound earnings), so we won’t have a lot of sales which generate taxable events. The advantage of having a taxable account is that you don’t have to wait until age 59.5 to withdraw. So hypothetically if you save enough in a post-tax account to earn enough to live off of (the general rule, in corollary with the 4% rule is that you require in savings 25 times the amount of your cost of living for a year. So a $25,000 a year cost of living requires a $625,000 egg). The goal here is to save enough in a post-tax account that you can retire when you have enough where you can siphon off the principal plus market earnings for each year’s cost of living to the point where you are 59.5 years old, when you can start withdrawing on your 401k and IRA retirement and it doesn’t matter that your post-tax account is now zero dollars. I chose Vanguard for this, because again I can invest in VTSAX there, but Ben once brought up Robinhood with me one day, which allows you to buy VTI (the VTSAX total stock market ETF equivalent) for free. My concern is that purchasing VTI at Vanguard is free anyway, if you want VTI instead of VTSAX or VFIAX (S&P500 index), and you want a company that will be around in 30 years and I’m not sure the Robinhood app won’t go out of business in that time. Personally I hope that never happens, but app companies are somewhat volatile. I’d say go with Vanguard again, they’ll definitely be around in 40 years. Keep investing in total stock market index funds (VTSAX or the VTI ETF, or else an S&P500 index if unavailable), so that you track the market. Reinvest your earnings while you are still working so you earn compound interest, then switch to having your earnings/dividends from your post-tax account put into your bank account when you do decide to retire.

And that’s basically it. You max out your pre-tax for as long as you can while you are young, and put the rest into post-tax for when you retire early, which hopefully will last you until age 59.5. A summary of this strategy is here: http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/11/29/how-to-retire-forever-on-a-fixed-chunk-of-money/ Again, this is extreme but since compounding is your friend, the earlier in age you max out your 401K/IRA contributions, the more you’ll have in retirement. Having a high savings rate (50% and up) from a young age is a great way to become financially independent very early in life, if that is one of your goals. If your goal isn't early retirement-- perhaps it is being able to contribute to charity/nonprofits or to pass on a sizeable inheritance to your kids-- the tactics of financial independence are still  useful.

### Allocation Strategy
There is another simple principle here: total bond market index is again a better investment that non-index bond funds. Jack Bogle (the founder of Vanguard) talks about it in the book mentioned above (Little Book of Common Sense Investing), but again, in brief, you want to index even bond funds.

Allocation strategies are a little too complex for a wiki, but I will share my allocation strategy (which I admit is rather extreme). During my “wealth acquisition phase”, which corresponds to the years I’m not retired and working, I am allocating 100% in stocks (particularly VTSAX in my IRA and VFIAX + a midcap index and a small-cap index in my 401K) in order to maximize gains when I’m not living off the principal anyway and don’t care about market volatility. When I do retire, I will switch to a 75% VTSAX and a 25% VBTLX (total bond market index fund) allocation. This is the “wealth preservation phase”, with bonds providing cushioning to market volatility. The strategy I follow, outlined at https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/ (which I highly recommend reading even if you aren’t going to go with this strategy just to learn about the market and index funds. A Google talk is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T71ibcZAX3I ), is focused on simplicity: only two funds (VTSAX and VBTLX), and only reallocating when you aren’t working or retired. The trade-off for simplicity is that you have to have a high tolerance for risk, since your portfolio will be strongly hit by market downturns. The most important thing to keep in mind, even if you aren’t following this strategy, is to never sell during market downturns. Everyone on the news and media will be telling you to sell when the market goes down significantly (sometimes as much as 50%, making your investment shrink by that much as well), but you have to be brave and vigilant and not sell. In fact, you should probably buy more index funds during market turbulence. An important way to conceptualize it is to think of market turns as not being that big of deal in reality, because the market usually recovers after some time (even 2008 took only two years to recover completely), and during those downswings stocks are actually on sale. Purchasing index funds during a market downturn can really improve your holdings, and as long as you don’t sell (you are, after all, buying stocks to hold forever for retirement), and you can find some great deals while everyone else (short-term dealers) are panicking.

Another allocation strategy is retirement target dates. Here you choose your target year of retirement (i.e. 2050) and the fund will automatically allocate bonds vs. equities as the years go by. These are actually a pretty sweet deal, because you basically can set it and forget it. Personally, I like choosing funds and strategizing how to keep expense ratios as low as possible, and reallocation isn’t that big of a deal (usually you only have to do it once a year), so I’ll take the additional earnings by having low expense ratios with index funds (target date funds usually have an expense ratio of .6-.7, whereas index funds have an expense ratio of .04). So I’ll just do it myself and keep the additional earnings. But target date funds are probably the best choice if you don’t know about allocation or don’t want to take the time to track your changes from year to year. I would just rather make sure I am investing in index funds rather than stocks and actively trading. Vanguard has target date funds, which do invest in index funds and as a result have a lower e/r than 401K target funds.

### Automatic Deposits
A great strategy to ensure you invest each month is to set your post-tax investment account (Vanguard does this) to automatically invest each time you receive a pay check. If you are maxing out your 401K, you are depositing each pay period a percentage of your paycheck into your 401K (say 30%). Do this with your post-tax account for whatever leftover amount you can save from your paycheck after substituting costs and deposit this set amount each paycheck to automatically invest in your index funds. The benefit of this is that you’re basically Dollar Cost Averaging, which prevents you from trying to market time (buying low, selling high) which is usually detrimental and counter-productive, since no one can predict the stock market (let alone successfully time the market consistently). When you are buying and holding investments for 30+ years, the day to day market fluctuations in price simple don’t matter and the most important factor is getting as much into the market for as long of time as possible. Automatic deposits again let you expend as little time and energy as possible on this, so that it becomes an afterthought.  Just budget for expenses accordingly and in thirty years you’ll thank yourself for setting up auto deposits instead of trying to do it manually.

### Frugality
There are plenty of books and reddit forums, for example, on living frugally, whether that means cooking cheaply or bringing your lunch/not eating out at restaurants or buying used cars or riding a bike, so you can study frugality tactics there and tailor them to your personal needs and requirements. Frugality is political, since it’s easy to take discussions of frugality as a moral judgment upon oneself since “consumerism” has been so demonized after the 1960's, and feelings can get hurt. So I won’t talk about it here, other than to say it’s important that, in case you start earning a higher salary, for example, not to let “lifestyle creep” flatten your savings rate. If you start earning more, it’s easy to start spending more on more expensive goods and services, but the goal after an increase in your salary should be to maintain the same lifestyle while increasing your savings rate instead. People call this lifestyle creep "hedonic adaptation," whereas more expensive goods only result in a temporary increase in your self-fulfillment, after which you quickly return to the same state as you were before your salary bump. So it's not worth it, essentially, to permit lifestyle creep. Put any bump in salary into savings and maintain the same frugal lifestyle, so that you can achieve your retirement goals earlier, when you can really have fun.

### Summary
Hey, just to be honest, we have a really unique situation that most people don’t have. Developer jobs pay well, but with the salary comes the decision of either living the high life or taking that extra amount and saving it towards retirement. For me, early retirement is really attractive because I have hobbies like art and music and reading that I could really focus on and develop with more time than is permitted with a full time working schedule. So my goal for the next decade is to live as frugally as possible and invest as wisely as possible in order to permit an earlier retirement. It’s an extreme case, but personal finance is important regardless to prepare you for the day you retire. It just so happens that the work necessary for a comfortable retirement is a lot easier (and less expensive) if you do it early in your life thanks to compounding, so this document is simply a gentle push not to sit out a potentially profitable/productive period of your life. Not everyone knows about index funds and Vanguard, but I think we all share the goals of living as comfortably as possible with the least amount of work (and money) required as possible, so I thought I’d share some strategies I picked up reading a lot of personal finance books the past year. If you have any questions or comments or want to share the love of personal finance, hit me up.

I know the other Life Tips write-ups deal with relevant PluralSight courses and such, and although there aren’t any PluralSight courses on financial independence at the time, I do have to say that the reason I got into this topic in the first place was because I was listening to a Treehouse podcast by their founder, who talked about and even interviewed Mr. Money Mustache. Treehouse is the web development training site that the Topeka Public Library subscribes to, which helped me learn modern full-stack web development while a student in CS at Washburn. So while PluralSight has some awesome “Life Tip” courses like Cory House’s “Become an Outlier Programmer,” I’d like to think of Financial Independence as also kind of having a home-town computer science spin because of the Topeka Public Library’s Treehouse subscription. I think being a computer scientist and having a grasp of personal finance, if not even having a goal of financial independence, especially working in the FinTech industry is a match made in heaven.

## What is Holm Schooling?


In the quest to get a first computer science job while spending as little money as possible, you can completely hack college education to get you to where you want to be. I call these techniques Holm Schooling, because unschooling doesn’t necessarily convey all the little tips and trick I want to teach through this site. Holm Schooling doesn’t mean you’re enrolled at Holm School – there’s no such place – but it means you’re applying a set of principles to maximize the goals of unschooling while not sacrificing the benefits of affordable public education. Let’s explore.

The first technique of Holm Schooling would be to study hard in high school and get good grades, good SAT scores, and earn National Merit Scholarship so that you can go to public university for free. In fact, if you do well enough at High School, the university might actually pay you to attend. But which university should you go to? In my opinion, the definitive answer to that is the public university (including community college) that is in your hometown. Moving out of your hometown is a huge financial burden and one that can sink frugality. In the interest of brevity, I will just emphasize one point: Living in a dorm rather than your family home requires you to subscribe to a board plan for food. You’re forced to purchase food from the university commons. University food is so expensive it should be criminal. Sometimes even if there are frugal options (my college offered beans and rice and spaghetti and sauce for a buck or two), you are still required to purchase a minimum amount of board points. Thus, even if you feed yourself frugally (which you probably won’t be able to), you’re still required to spend all your remaining board credits at the end of the year. I bought a hotplate off ebay my freshman year so that I could cook in the dorms. You shouldn’t need to do this. Living at home and not living in a castle-like dorm can save you thousands of dollars a year. Since I suggest you go to whatever college is in your hometown, that you should live at home instead of living in a dorm is a given. You can cook frugally at home and pack your meals in zip lock bags for microwaving at college (carry a plastic Tupperware bowl in your backpack).

The next suggestion is, if you are paying per credit instead of an annual fee (common in public universities), only take classes in the computer science/math department. This is only if you didn’t receive a scholarship – scholarships usually require a minimum amount of credit hours, so you might as well work towards your bachelors in science degree. But if you are paying per credit hour, just enroll in computer science and math classes. Here’s the suggestion: Take as many computer science classes at community college as you can, then take as many computer science classes at public university (in your hometown) as you can. Don’t worry about anything other than computer science classes and their concomitant requirements. Forget about liberal arts classes or anything other than STEM classes. At the end of four years, you should have enough credits to qualify for a bachelor’s of science degree in computer science. Sometimes this means you’ll only take one to three computer science classes per semester. But since you’ll be focusing only on these two CS classes each semester, you can study above and beyond the basic requirements of the class and pull off an A in each class.
As you take as many computer science classes as you can at the community college/public university in your hometown, living at home, you’ll save money by not taking the requirements for a bachelor’s degree (i.e. public speaking, technical writing, economics, etc.). These things you can study on your own on the internet, it is silly to pay the same amount of money you are paying for a computer science class for “requirements” for a B.S. Once you have taken all the computer science classes (and just computer science/math classes) as you can, you’ll start applying for jobs. If you list all your computer science classes taken on your resume, employers will see that you have completed a computer science degree even though you haven’t taken the requirements for a B.S. At this point, you have Holm Schooled yourself into a first computer science job while spending the minimum amount of money for public university classes.
Once you get your first job (make sure it is a job with tuition reimbursement as a benefit), you can apply to be a student at the University of the People. They accept transfer credit, so you should be able to send your transcript and qualify for most of their CS courses. Instead, you’ll finish out the B.S. requirements for a UoPeople computer science degree. This will be where your B.S. is from, but your hometown university will be where most of your CS classes are accredited. Because your employer offers tuition reimbursement (and you’ll qualified for transfer credit at UoPeople), finishing up your B.S. while you work your first job could cost mere hundreds of dollars. And you won’t need to rush through your remaining online classes, because you are already working and already acquiring experience.

This works if you didn’t receive a scholarship to attend the university in your hometown and are paying a flat fee for each credit hour. Taking only computer science classes is a great way to reduce your work load so that you can study extra hard and get A’s in each of your CS classes, while also not paying for those silly degree requirement classes such as liberal arts classes that are where most of your money is wasted in pursuit of B.S. Stick to CS/Math/STEM classes and you’ll use your tuition dollars most wisely in your quest to get a first programming job.

Notice how I haven’t even mentioned the public library? This is where Holm Schooling gets really interesting. The spine/backboard of Holm Schooling is to take just CS/Math classes at your hometown university while living at home. This will allow you to have the university experience that so many people crave while also remaining frugal and ensuring that you have time to focus as many hours of the day possible on computer science instead of other silly liberal arts classes which waste your money and effort. You can get a job just taking computer science classes at university – I took eight CS classes at my hometown university (costing $8000), and because I studied Treehouse for free through my public library with the extra time I had not taking other classes in pursuit of B.S. degree (just two CS classes each semester), I was able to start working as a web developer.

Holm Schooling makes liberal use of open education. For each class I was enrolled in at university, I was sure to watch every open courseware class that was available online on the same topic. I studied far more than what was required on the syllabus, and made sure that I crammed as much studying (using open educational resources, Library Genesis, interlibrary loans, or my public library stacks) so that I could read as many textbooks on each subject that I took. All of this cost zero extra dollars. Open educational resources like open courseware gave me a semester’s worth of lectures many times over for each class. Library Genesis gave an unlimited supply of textbooks each semester without the overhead of applying for interlibrary loans and waiting for books to be delivered. My public library provided Treehouse and Lynda so that I could study web development during my winter and fall break so that I could study programming beyond what was available at university. Living at home for a majority of the time also meant that I could cook lentils and beans and peas for lunch each day, so that I never ate at the cafeteria and kept costs as low as possible. Holm Schooling means sticking with public universities – never going to private universities, which are a tremendous waste of money even with a scholarship and also don’t even particularly emphasize STEM anyway. Holm Schooling means at the extent that you’ve completely all the CS classes offered at your hometown university, you finish up your B.S. at University of the People for roughly a thousand dollars (while working your first programming job, with tuition reimbursement). Holm Schooling means using your public library for all the odds and ends regarding computer science that aren’t offered through your university or even open courseware and MOOCs. You have access to hundreds of programming books and possibly even thousands of programming video tutorials if your public library subscribes to Treehouse or Lynda. Holm Schooling means completing all the other classes that you are interested in for free via MOOCs or open courseware instead of paying for non-CS classes at university. Holm Schooling means using OER and library genesis to study topics above and beyond what are required on the syllabus. Holm Schooling even means that you can completely forgo the university altogether if there is not one available in your hometown, and use internet resources and your public library to supply your studies of computer science. With Library Genesis, every person has an academic library where they can borrow the latest and most important computer science books. The university library has been digitalized and is now available online through Library Genesis, reducing the need to physically enroll in a university. You can now study the same books that were previously only available in the university stacks now at home without even being a student. This is great, and soon things will be legitimized when you can subscribe to a Spotify for books for a monthly fee. We’re maybe a few years away from that. In the meantime, Library Genesis means that every person on Earth has a public university library at their disposal.

Holm Schooling means never buying the latest and greatest computers while you are still just a student. If you buy the cheapest desktop (a Raspberry Pi for $50) and an eight year-old, $100 laptop with Linux installed on it, you should be able to afford the minimum computing requirements for learning how to code. Once you get a job, you’ll be supplied a laptop through which you can pursue learning how to program more for zero equipment costs. Holm Schooling could even mean just using the public library’s computers, and using a cloud IDE to store and run your programs. Holm Schooling means that studying computer science should be accessible to every person in America, because the equipment requirements are as low as possible. You can often check out Raspberry Pi’s from your public library. You can check out a laptop there too. The public library has free internet. If you are paying for public university classes, you can use all the public computer labs instead of going into debt to pay for your own shiny laptop. Learning how to use Linux means you can use a much older laptop than is possible using other operating systems, plus you’ll learn how to use Linux which is often a requirement for programming jobs. Holm Schooling means acquiring nothing in your quest to learn how to program, and instead use every single piece of public equipment available at your means, whether as a public library patron, a public university student, or an employee at a job.

Now let’s discuss the edge cases. Let’s say you don’t have a community college or a public university in your hometown. Then the answer to the frugal Holm Schooler is obvious: study online! Enroll at the University of the People and visit all the open educational resources cataloged in our curriculum and its references at the bottom to design your own curriculum for computer science. Remember, the goal is not to acquire prestigious university degrees, it’s to get a good first job programming so that you can gain experience and even pump as much money as possible into your 401(K) while you’re young, all while making use of tuition reimbursement to fill the holes in your education that were required to maintain frugality in pursuit of your first programming job. Holm Schoolers aren’t afraid to be, well, home schooled in computer science. Home schooling is very possible through open education resources and open courseware, not including the free resources offered by your public library. Living at home and studying computer science for four years is a great way to start your career using as little cash as possible. A Holm Schooler would even question the need for public university in this day and age. Most computer science topics can be learned for free through the internet. Programming just requires a computer, which can be bought for $35 from Raspberry Pi. The tens of thousands of dollars required to attend public university could fund decades of Treehouse or PluralSight or Lynda. Why take liberal arts classes for a thousand dollars a pop in pursuit of a degree requirement when you could read the OER on the topic published by [openstax.org](http://www.openstax.org) and watch an open courseware too. Public university isn’t a requirement when it involves moving to a different city and paying for housing on top of tuition. You can pursue degrees in CS online through UoPeople. You can study through the internet. You can maintain your friends you made in high school instead of leaving them for a different city altogether. You can save enough money now that you aren’t in debt when you get your first programming job, so instead of paying off loans and their interest, you can maximize your 401K contributions and sock the rest of your earning money into Vanguard’s VTSAX index fund. The importance of frugality begs the question why only start being frugal after you graduate, why not be frugal in regards to the years 18-22? If you want to be 22 and not have tens of thousands of dollars of debt when you start your first programming job, then stick to free programming resources. Holm Schoolers know that they can learn anything they need to know for programming for roughly $200 a year plus the cost of internet. Holm Schoolers, instead of taking a $1000 intro to liberal arts class, used the time to study _HOW_ to study computer science for free on the internet. With that time investment learning about OER, Open Education, Open Source Licenses, Open Courseware, and public library subscriptions like Treehouse and Lynda, they learned everything they need to accomplish their goals in computer science for free. For the rest of their lives! By reading this blog and learning the basics of Holm Schooling, their time investment allows them to bypass the cost of higher education that isn’t already available in their hometown, and pursue their education for very low cost through the internet. Why spend tens of thousands of dollars getting a degree when you can spend roughly $200 a year for four years and still ending up with a paying job. After that, _then_ you pursue higher education while qualifying for tuition reimbursement through your employer.

Holm Schooling isn’t guaranteed to be successful – you’ll still have to study CS as hard as you can for four years straight and have the competency required for a job. But it will save you money in this day and age of tuition hell. Holm Schoolers realize that the university has been replaced through Library Genesis, Open Educational Resources, and Open Courseware. When faced with the question of whether to spend hundreds of dollars versus ten thousand dollars for a year of education in CS, Holm Schoolers will boot up their Raspberry Pi, do a google search for some nice github repsositories filled with links to good MOOCs and Open Coursewares, “borrow” some books from Library Genesis or else download some OER, and get started studying for free. Saving ten thousand dollars a year will allow them to avoid loans so that they can invest in index funds/VTSAX while in their twenties. If they live frugally and save 50-75% of their take home pay while maximizing their 401K and IRA contributions each year in their early twenties, they will be assuring their financial independence later in life as those investments gain compound interest instead of paying for loan interest. Holm Schoolers read voraciously about the FIRE movement and know that Holm Schooling is an appropriate tactic for financial independence/early retirement. The sooner a Holm Schooler learns about Holm Schooling, the sooner they’ll be prepared for a lifetime of self-directed learning for a mere $200 dollars a year. And since a Holm Schooler is saavy with financial independence, they’ll be investing in VTSAX early in life so that they can retire as soon as possible since they’ve lived so frugally for a decade more than their peers (even in regards to education). Holm Schooling means having more time to self-educate in the important stuff (computer science) since you’re not obligated to pay out the wazoo for silly liberal arts requirements in pursuit of a B.S. Holm Schooling means knowing that the university isn’t a requirement for success in 2018, and the role of the university in regards to computer science education will continue to decrease as more EdTech startups are invented and subscribed to by public libraries. Holm Schoolers put more trust into their local public library than they do private universities located across the country. And Holm Schoolers know that computer scientists will continue to invent technology that will allow for computer science to be studied for free on the internet by more and more people around the world. Their bets are placed squarely in this open source realm versus the realm of the brick and mortar university, with their bottom line that requires profits and proprietary licensing. To the Holm Schooler, the expensive brick and mortar university (after the invention of the internet and affordable computing) has as much chance for survival as telephone operators. Though some fun is to be had on traditional campuses, the costs for this fun are better spent on Vanguard Index Funds and an internet connection/raspberry pi and inexpensive home cooked vegan food with a bike. Social lives can and will survive outside of the university. People can and will live happy lives even if they don’t immediately leave their hometown at age 18 in pursuit of fame and a PhD. Going to the public university in your hometown can and will lead to quality education even if you don’t go to a private university on the coast. Frugality and extreme saving can and will lead to fulfilling lives even in the day and age of loans and debts and automobiles and shiny computers, paid for with credit cards.

Holm Schooling is an important part of FIRE. It’s an extension of FIRE to education. In the day and age of the internet, paying for expensive brick and mortar universities makes as much sense as buying expensive automobiles. Though infinitely attractive, the cost of the latter just doesn’t meet justification under scrutiny. Holm Schooling is a bicycle instead of a car. Holm Schooling is OER and a book from the public library instead of a used $150 textbook. Holm Schooling is University of the People even if you are smart enough to go to a private school. Holm Schooling is knowing that the benefits of an elite education are overblown, and exercising your frugality while young is a better benefit to the quality of your life than splurging on a degree. Holm Schooling knows that university is only four years, while Holm Schooling is self-education every year for the rest of your life. Do you think universities will teach you how to be self-sufficient regarding education? Do you think universities will teach you that everything they teach can be gleaned for free through the internet? Do you think universities will teach you that they operate under a deprecated and unnecessarily expensive model in the day and the age of internet EdTech? Will a university teach you how to learn without making use of university resources? Obviously no.

So start being frugal today and study computer science as inexpensively as possible through your public library. Holm Schoolers live a life of extreme savings (not debt), and as a result live in ways that ensure their prosperity through life. Universities make a killing off the false hopes that are offered to all that sign their contract. Holm Schoolers know that success is a result of hard work and intensive study of computer science, and not by purchasing a degree that promises you’re a competent computer scientist in exchange for tens of thousands of dollars. Holm Schoolers know that in the day and age where FIRE is readily researchable and guidelines for early retirement are written for free on the internet, that not being frugal with regards to age 18-22 is a wasted opportunity. Holm Schoolers decide to turn 22 not with a debt that cuts into their 401K savings for years, but to begin their first job maximizing their 401K and IRA and putting the leftovers into VTSAX. Because they went to their hometown public university and lived at home and cooked for themselves and only studied CS instead of moving away for a private university, they kept with the philosophy of 50-75% savings even during their college years. They still got a job, and they still have wonderful careers as self-taught computer scientists. Holm Schoolers are a saavy bunch, I highly suspect if you learn a bit more about their beliefs, you’ll come to appreciate their decisions too. 

## Why People Don't Understand Open Source, From the Perspective of an Art Historian

In the Renaissance, there was a revolution in the way things were drawn. Perspective was invented and slowly perfected, and realism became the norm as optical instruments allowed for scientific study of sight and dimensionality. The flat people of the illuminated manuscript became three dimensional portraits. In a way, the mode of doing things was forever changed. The old way fell out of favor in the capitalist competitivity of innovative artistic depiction. Artists combined science with art to push both science and the arts in tandem. To question why perspective was never invented before the Renaissance is useless, as innovation justifies itself for the future and doesn't condemn the past.

Similarly, open source became the norm in the aughts for computer science, and the innovation it engendered justifies itself for the future. In not condemning the past, we can't question why copyright was the mainstay of civilization. The most obvious answer is that there wasn't a need for open source, because there weren't a means of distributing open source content to the masses (and scientists) when there weren't even computer networks. Just like there weren't means of distributing realism in painting to the masses (and scientists) when there weren't even oil paints. But just because you can't condemn the choices made in the past, you can't expect the decisions of the past to continue to be the defacto choice for the future. That's because innovation becomes mixed with capitalism and competitivity, and no one wants to pay for old methods of production when science has enabled a new, better, and more efficient method of production. That's what oil paints and perspective were in the Renaissance, and that's what open source licensing for computer science and education was in the aughts.

It's hard to believe people weren't accepting of the advances in realism in painting during the Renaissance. If anyone argued for the old means of portraiture at that time, their voice has been lost to the dustbin of history. Because painting was never the same, and practicing artists were expected to be able to draw life realistically. The same is true of computer scientist and educators, as their means of practice now expect them to produce open source products. That's because open source is science, and science is the carrier of progress in civilization. Just like the Renaissance engendered the ending of faith in god as the motive for social organization, open source computer science has engendered the ending of intellectual property as the motive for social organization. It's just the boring march of progress as we abandon that which might have worked in the past, but can no longer be justified due to the advances in science. And with the invention of the internet, science has decided open source matches the reality with which civilization is beset. Just as the Romantics argued against the Enlightenment and scientific civilization, opponents of open source argue against... Enlightenment ideals of freedom and liberty and scientific civilization. But those are all voices that will be lost to history, mark my words. We can't put the genie of the internet back into the bottle. Copyright was an acceptable paradigm for many years, but it can no longer be defended. Open source is the defacto means of creative production for the future. Just like civilization didn't end with the Renaissance, but actually improved, civilization won't end with the dominance of open source, but will improve. It is that improvement that most people are now extremely excited about, to the point that Archive.org is risking its economic safety in order to teach people and digital online self-education. Because people need to understand that the internet is built upon freedoms and rights like fair use and affordability. Because the ubiquity of free online education is very unlikely to be a destructive force. It might actually transform the world and lift even more people out of poverty. That's the end goal of science anyway.

Science has always taken a hit when its popularity takes a punch at its oppressor. Churches killed scientists and music labels threatened piraters with million dollar lawsuits. But science and art are always intertwined, there cannot be art without science. Good art is good science. And since science is open source, good art too is open source. That people think they can control good art through mystical intellectual property laws in the day and age of the internet is a feeble attempt to hang out to the old system of art. But people don't want illuminated manuscripts in the day and age of the Mona Lisa, and people don't want copywritten art in the day and age of open source. You can spend your money burning scientists (if you're the church) and threatening file sharing protocol programmers (if you're music labels or book publishers), but civilization marches forward on the laurels of the new science. People cringe at old, bad art and take comfort in knowing that things have improved since then. And people will cringe in the future when they look back at copyright, and be glad open source has improved everything it touches. Art isn't necessarily good just because it's open source, but good art will necessarily be open source after this moment in history.

If you enjoy realism, you'll be happy that artists worked with scientists to invent perspective in the Renaissance. And if you enjoy education, you'll be happy that educators worked with computer scientists to invent open educational resources in the twenty-twenties. It's not just that it's a scene, it's literally the foundation of everything civilization will accomplish in the future, right here in the present. To argue against science is to argue that civilization can't improve, that's we're at the apex of history and efficiency. But considering that the Archive.org is being threatened because it opened up its CDL library during a worldwide quarantine is evidence that science is still viewed with skepticism by many. But regardless of the fight, however short it will probably be, kids will be able to learn science and art more affordably, quickly, and deeper than my generation did. And that is good, because the public domain is Artificial Intelligence for the human race. A more robust public domain isn't a curse to be fought against, it's the very thing that engenders progress and creature comforts that make life happier and less painful. If you're against the public domain, you're against science and art.

It's very easy to cast computer scientists as iconoclasts, but the desire to preserve and distribute art is hardly iconoclastic. If we are the iconoclasts, as purported by the enemies of Archive.org, then what an anodyne enemy to disparage. It's a testiment to science that computer scientists and public librarians are iconoclasts, which is simply just another example of projection from spooked clergymen. The Enlightenment wasn't an act of iconoclasm, as the advances in art during the Renaissance was a result of cryptic interest in science, not religion. And the advances as open source and fair use in the public domain is a result of more cryptic interest in science, not universities. Universities are the papacy of today, which extract money and food from the mouths of hungry children in return for indulgences called degrees. It's unfortunate that was used to be an Enlightenment project became the oppressor of children. But regardless of irony, the institute of the university is being replaced by the democratic practice of open source education. Just like religion didn't go away, the university, music labels, and book publishers won't go away. But they'll be a footnote as civilization moves on in stunning ways. Archive.org isn't a criminal worth a burning at the stake by the church of the Authors Guild. Anyone invested in science should know that. Archive.org is building the public domain because the public domain builds civilization.

Open source is not necessarily obvious to anyone who has never thought about the practice of copyright. It's just a small alternative in the art of software. But it doesn't take long to see that the science it engenders justifies its dominance very quickly. What was an alternative becomes the norm. Normalcy is a powerful force in civilization, and the displacement of an old method of social production is always a stressful time. But if you are fighting open source and fair use, know that you are fighting science. And temporal victories don't mean victory in the long term. Because science is a very powerful thing, especially when combined with art in such a way that creates good art that promotes good science, and vice versa. Once a Spotify for Books is created, there will no longer be bizarre practices of going deep into debt when young just to read a couple hundred books in a university library over four years. You can read those couple hundred books in your room for $200 a year instead of $40,000. And that will grant you the freedom to go against the norm and innovate instead of following custom and the promise of a paycheck. When fair use and the internet grant you freedom and liberty, anyone proposing a limitation to your newfound liberty will be fought. And laugh at. That's what we're experiencing now with the Author's Guild and Archive.org, in which the ones threatening a paradigm that gives liberty and freedom to children are being laughed off stage. Education doesn't need to be a great expense in the age of computer networks. People will fight to make education free and open, because they know science is similarly better when it is free and open. Because education, science, art, and democracy are all interlinked. To impede one is to impede all, and anyone proposes such an act will be upbraided.

Perhaps open source needs a public awareness campaign to people outside the sciences. But I doubt it, it seems even without such a campaign most people know that open source will become the defacto method of licensing for most things in the future. It's just an act to argue otherwise, and act that might pay the bills in the shortterm but has no long game. It's just pussyfooting around reality. It's hard to appreciate illuminated manuscripts when Leonardo is in town. And it's hard to appreciate the Authors Guild when Archive.org is in town. Affordable education is a right, not a privilege. Accordingly, fair use will expand to accompany online public libraries in their fight to digitize and archive the analog for a digital generation. It's not an act of iconoclasm, it's a recognition that the rules of the game have changed, and that those changes are good and just although they go against the norm. I don't think scientists fear being outsiders, and that's why open source will succeed. Because outsider status is extremely fleeting when backed by good science. People want science. People want open source. It's just that they're a bit scared to say it out loud, when the boss/preacher/professor is watching.

## Work Your Way Out of Your Public University Career Into A Programming Career

Don't be afraid to work your way out of your status as a student of computer science. If you've read some of my blog posts, you'll know I recommend going to the public university if your hometown has one, while you live at home to say on rent. It's not exactly glamorous, but moving to a different city to attend university doesn't make much sense, because you aren't working so you can't afford it. If you don't have a public university in your hometown, attend University of the People. Of course, if you don't have a public or community college in your hometown, it will probably be less likely that they will have a lot of programming jobs, but that is something you'll have to determine and strategize yourself and your career prospects in your hometown.

If your hometown does have career prospects for programmers, there is no reason why you should extend your (unpaid) time as a computer science student, but instead implement a career path that will replace your status as a student as soon as feasibly possible. Take me for an example. I attended three semesters of public university in my hometown and only took computer science classes. Because my workload was lighter because I didn't have to take liberal arts courses for requirements, I was able to put more time into my computer science studies and read extra textbooks, did unassigned p-sets, and programmed a lot of extra topics through free services provided through my public library like Treehouse (and eventually Lynda). Because I accelerated my studies, I did well in my classes. In my third semester, someone from a local company came to recruit summer interns for their organization. Having done well in my classes and because I was studying web programming in my free time using Treehouse, I got an internship on the company's web team.

My boss on the web team purchased me a PluralSight account using company funds, in order that I could study Angular. This was very nice of him, and it helped me greatly after the summer in my networking class because PluralSight has quite a lot of CCNA material. Eventually I realized that what I was learning in PluralSight (free through my internship) and Treehouse (free through my public library) was more relevant to my career as a web developer than paying for university classes. I took a semester off to utilize my PluralSight account that I was receiving as a benefit of being a summer intern. However, because I was no longer a student, I applied for some jobs that seemed interesting and asked for knowledge about topics I had studied through Treehouse, and I got a full-time programming job at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. As an employee, I spent my free time after work continuing to study Treehouse and eventually just bought myself a PluralSight account for $200 a year. My job also offered tuition reimbursement, so I easily could have finished up my B.S. in computer science through UoPeople. But because I already had a liberal arts degree, with my accruing work experience I could have applied to Georgia Tech's OMSCS masters degree and have it only cost a couple of thousand dollars total. But Treehouse was free (and I'm always worried that my public library will stop subscribing, since I'm sure it's expensive for them, so I never squander the privilege of having a free account) and eventually worked my way to thirtieth place in Treehouse for points. Even though I only went to four semesters of college (totalling $8000), I have a good enough resume to get computer science jobs now that I got a job/experience instead of finishing a C.S. B.S.

I now have a job at the place where I did my internship, and in a year I will qualify for tuition reimbursement and this time around I am definitely not going to sleep on it and I will try for a OMSCS master's. I reached the place that benefits from internships outweighed the price of college tuition, so I stopped going to college, and the experience on my resume of having an internship got me a junior dev job. Having a junior dev job qualified me for tuition reimbursement, but having my free public library Lynda and Treehouse accounts kept me educated about web dev so that I could get another web development job. Now I again qualify for tuition reimbursement, and because I am interested in UoPeople and OMSCS the cost to continue studying will be very small after tuition reimbursement. In other words, just by working hard in my public university for a few semesters, I quickly earned my way out of having to pay tuition, and instead I'm now at the place where continuing my education is free.

You should aim to work your way out of your status as a student by earning internships that have rewards and benefits like PluralSight accounts that will provide a means of learning new programming topics. You should take what you learn from your internships and attempt to get a job as soon as possible, so that you don't have to keep paying tuition but can earn an income while qualifying for benefits like tuition reimbursement. You should use UoPeople and OMSCS to (slowly) earn your credentials while working hard at your job, also studying programming topics through cheap resources like Treehouse, Lynda, and PluralSight. You can keep the total cost to you low by trying to accelerate your education as quickly as possible by keeping costs low (such as using an old computer running linux or university resources) so that you don't have to work to cover bills, giving you more free time to study. If you only take CS courses, too, you'll have more time for programming. Work your way out of student status and into a career that will pay you to be a student on the side. If you do this at a public university in your hometown, you can keep total expenses very low (either by avoiding getting a full bachelors degree and all the side requirement classes, or by leaving college early to take up a job, or by working as an intern during the summer to pay your tuition). Use your public library's CS stack to boost your programming language knowledge so that you qualify for job requirements and get those internships. Your internships possibly will provide you with a PluralSight account or something similar.

Becoming a computer scientist doesn't have to cost a lot. If you can't afford public university, you can try UoPeople or else use OER or Library Genesis combined with OpenCourseWare and your public library CS stack. Knowing how to program will earn you internships, which will earn you jobs. Many programming jobs have benefits like tuition reimbursement, which will allow you to earn your degrees in your freetime for a fraction of the cost of even your public university if you use UoPeople and OMSCS. It is important that you view university not as a task (a bachelor's degree), but something optional that only serves to get your foot in the door of the industry, so that you can replace what you learn at university with job experience and educational benefits provided by the employer. Don't think you have to earn a master's degree in CS before you get a job. You can keep your time in university down to a matter of a couple years if you fully utilize all the free resources available on the internet for CS education, as demonstrated by this site's OER curriculum. Don't be fooled into thinking you can't afford to become a computer scientist. If you study CS, even just at your public library, you will find people will happily pay you to continue studying CS, taking the cards of unaffordable tuition off the table completely. Turn an expense into an earning, as quickly as possible, so that you can leave the university early and stop paying those ridiculous tuition prices.

My point in talking about this isn't to say that if you are still in school you aren't working hard enough or something like that. All I'm saying is the educational benefits you can find in the workplace are often more relevant to your career and programming skill requirements than what you learn in university. So, earning those benefits from your employment often promotes your career even more than being in university. So the sooner you gain educational benefits from employment instead of university, the sooner you can not only learn more important and relevant things, but you can also continue your university studies online for cheap at the same time you're learning stuff related to your job. Make the jump into the workforce as soon as possible if you're a university student. You might just find that you learn more on the job and through educational benefits than what you learn in the university classroom. At which point university, after a couple of years on the job, seems all together unappealing for spending your time and money. When you can learn quite a lot through PluralSight, which can be provided through your job as a benefit, or through Lynda or Treehouse, which can be provided through your public library, relying on university with it's $1000+ per course fees seems passe and quaint, at best. It's truly a different age, and I found the quicker I entered the workforce, the happier I was regarding my computer science education (after I learned how to program in my university program the first two years -- after that I could self-educate online).


## How You Can Be Sure Your Public Library Will Pay For Your College Education In The Future

Take this for an example: You're watching TV, and an actor pops up. You hear that the actor was born in Michigan. You're from Michigan, so you are curious exactly where the actor was born. So you bring out your cell phone or tablet, google the actor, and look at their Wikipedia Information. Finding the city, you return to focusing on the TV.

Here's what you didn't do: You didn't write down the actors name, but the piece of paper by your car keys as a reminder, after work drive to the public library, and go to the reference section and get an encyclopedia to look up their biography. This method of research is done. Very few reasons exist why you would spend the gas to drive to the library, take the energy to walk to the reference section from the parking lot, and return to you car and drive home. You just google it on your tablet.

Now, what do you think the implications of people using Wikipedia instead of the public library's reference section are to the public library and their bottom line? Your public library doesn't have to spend so much money on reference material like encyclopedias about actors. They don't have to expend the space in their limited library to house books. They can cut their expenditures and replace biographies with other books they feel will be more useful for patrons. The usefulness of Google basically eliminates much of the former obligations of a library to serve Google's present functionality.

If the public library as a research utility has been in some ways replaced by internet services, what is the library going to do with the money they are saving? Well, take computer science books for example: Instead of keeping up with the latest books about new programming languages in their stack by purchasing new books each year, they can relax their feelings of obligations to keeping up with new CS books and instead put some of the money towards online educational services like Treehouse or Lynda. Books were expensive formerly, and even though these new online educational services take up the expense that they're saving by not purchasing new CS books, they are able to fit it within budget and provide a new online educational service that provides the same services as those books formerly did, only now it's online and more easily accessible (to patrons, who can just log in at home and start their learning) while also covering the latest programming languages and frameworks. Video tutorials are also very different than book learning (I would say better, especially for coding where you're required to view a lot of text on the screen), so the patrons get a better service for the same amount of money that the books formerly cost the public library. These educational services directly compete with the cost of higher education.

Treehouse is a good supplement to computer science classes at college. You can learn basic programming languages very well at Lynda. Both of these services are free for library patrons. Why would you pay tens of thousands of dollars for college when your public library offers a comparable educational experience for free? That's not even counting the free open educational services like Open CourseWare or OER that you can find on the internet, forever free and forever open source.

Then take for example the fact that online college degrees are increasingly becoming cheaper and cheaper (not in-person courses, but just online classes). UofPeople is $4000 and Georgia Tech OMSCS is $7000. What happens when colleges compete and use new internet technology to provide a college degree for the same cost as Treehouse? If the public library is willing to pay for Treehouse, they will probably be willing to pay for the affordable and accredited college degree. Compounding this will be the fact that online resources that are invented will cause the public library to have to pay less and less money for sufficient books to cover basic research. They'll have more money in their bottom line to pay for things like inexpensive online college degrees. Eventually we'll cross a threshold where online education that is accredited is as inexpensive as online educational services like Treehouse or Lynda, effectively making the public library the provider of a free college education.

This is inevitable. UofPeople is only nine years old and Treehouse is only 7 years old. Inexpensive online education is a new technology that relies on video and OER. As free services bring down the cost of hosting video (it's already free on YouTube thanks to Google) and OER continues to be written by more and more authors, the ubiquity of inexpensive online education services will grow. With more options for the public library's computer science expenditures, with less traditional obligations to outdated resources like paper books, the public library will be able to afford (accredited) equivalents of college education.

Treehouse already believes their resources provide the equivalent of a college degree. If public libraries already are subscribing to Treehouse, what's to say that the online educational resources provided by the public library won't continue to expand as the expense for these services decrease more and more each year?

So the question is, how long will it take for the budget of public library's computer science section to cover a fully accredited online college degree? My guess is ten years. If you can't hold on for that long, perhaps you want to write a few letters to your public library expounding on the importance of subscribing to inexpensive online educational services like Treehouse and Lynda. That way it won't be an all or nothing wait, but you can take advantage of the current technology for online learning that many public libraries are willing to pay for. Perhaps you can even use OER to fill in the educational gaps. Perhaps online education will truly be free (with accreditation), or perhaps you can feel confident to be self taught and use the public library and internet's free resources to learn computer science. I will tell you this, technology is continuously improving and hedging tens of thousands of dollars for a college degree now might not be the wisest bet given the resources that are available now through your public library. In my opinion, accredited college degrees in computer science will eventually be free, with the tuition covered by your public library. If you are impoverished, the public library will make sure that you have the resources to become a computer scientist. Be sure to thank them if they are already coming through, or prod them to switch to subscribing to online educational resources if they currently do not.

Inexpensive public universities and community colleges are still a very good option for impoverished computer scientists, but if you keep track of the quality and number of free services provided by public libraries versus the increasing cost of public colleges, you will come to the conclusion that studying at the library increasingly provides a way to potentially save tens of thousands of dollars and avoid the hassle of having to drive to school (such as the way you once had to drive to the public library to find biographical information of an actor), plus pay tuition! At least the public library was always free. The savings stand to be immense. Insist on being educated for free and your frugality will pay off with immense savings that you can budget your bottomline with. Computer Science education can, should, and will be free in the future. I would say it currently is if you use open educational resources while supplementing with your public library's resources. This trend will only increase and accelerate.

Do you use google instead of driving to the public library when you need a question answered? If you answered "yes," you will be sure that you will use your public library's online educational resources instead of a brick and mortar college to provide your education in the future, too. Just wait for it, and plan accordingly.

## The Secrets of Compounding Interest, From A Programmer's Perspective

[Khan Academy - Rule of 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mec-QpjQMXY)

One of the benefits of learning binary is that you become quite adept at learning how to convert 2^x values into an appropriate approximation. 2^10 is roughly equal to 1,000, 2^20 is roughly equal to 1,000,000, 2^30 is roughly equal to 1,000,000,000, etc. The power, divided by ten, results in three zeros times that number: i.e. 2^10 is ~1000, 2^20 is ~1,000,000, 2^30 is ~1,000,000,000, 2^40 is 1,000,000,000,000 etc. The number in front of those zeros multiples of three zeros is just 2 raised to that value modulus ten, i.e. 2^14 is 1,000 times 2^4, or 16,000, and 2^24 is 1,000,000 time 2^4, or 16,000,000, 2^36 is 1,000,000,000 times 2^6, or 64,000,000,000, etc.

Learning binary is a great way to learn the power of doubling. Just adding a single number to the power of two results in an explosion of the base ten number's value. Think how long it would take to count between the various powers of 2 if you were individually saying the ticks, it would become too long to pursue very quickly. The power of doubling is apparent when you study base two.

The import lies in learning about the Rule of 72, or the rough approximation that the amount of time for your investment to double is 72 divided by the interest rate. For a total stock market index fund or S&P500 index fund, your interest rate is around 10%. So it takes approximately 7 years for your investment to double. That's an amazing realization, that you can double your money every seven years. Mix that with the inherent understanding of binary digits that many computer scientists have, and you'll discover that doubling your money is extremely powerful! Take the results of the Rule of 72 for a given interest rate, and then raise 2 to the power of number of times you can double for a given time span. 40 years of 10% interest (age 25-65) is 5.7... 2 to the fifth is 32 and two to the sixth is 64, so choose a number between 32 and 64 to cover that .7 decimal... An investment amount at age 25 is going to be multiplied by ~48 given that time span (maxing out your 401k and IRA from 22-25 would enable $75,000 of principal, or $3.4 million (which is roughly 75k * 48)). That is to say, the amount you save at 22-25 is worth 48 times its face value. Ponder that for your retirement goals! The longer you wait, the smaller the multiplicator. That's the magic of compounding and the rule of seventy-two. It's a real world instance of binary and adding an exponent to 2.

When you're talking about investment time spans, even early investments in VTSAX/VFIAX at age 22 have the opportunity to double five and a half times by the time you're sixty. That's two to the power of five, or roughly multiplying your investment by 32. That means, when you are young and starting your career, a maxed out 401k and IRA are going to be worth 32 times the amount you put in. What a golden opportunity, it's almost like mathematics from the heavens. That is to say, when you analyze the cost of college, you need to multiply what your tuition will be by 32! A $60,000 private college degree is equivalent to $1.92 million dollars opportunity cost. That's why you can see how dangerous debt is when you're young, because you're stuck paying off debt for meaningless trivialities like pretigious degrees when you could be putting that money into index funds. Avoiding debt, especially during your youth, enables you to do life hacks like maxing out your 401k and IRA and putting that money into index funds, which enable you to earn 3200% gains during the decades up until your retirement. That's why colleges are especially devastating financially. That student loan costs you 32 times the list price. Would you pay a million dollars to learn to code when there are a panoply of free resources to learn programming online, which you could study instead? Learning to program is certainly valuable, since a programming job is very lucrative (and fun!). Why not gain the benefit of a programming job with the benefit of avoiding early debt, and teach yourself to program free using OER, or affordably with Treehouse/Lynda/PluralSight + UoPeople?

Here's the interesting part: Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate (google "mr money mustache the 4% rule"), you can multiply the factor you multiply your savings by at the current age (in the case of 22 years old, 32) and then times that by .04 to figure out the equivalent that saving at your age adds to your yearly withdrawl amount at the age of retirement. So at age 22, which is 32 * .04 (1.28), you are earning $1.28 in retirement money for each dollar you save. So if you max out your IRA and 401K at $25,000 a year at age 22, you are saving something around $32,000 for a yearly withdrawl at retirement. Do this over the course of around 5 years from age 22-28, and you're facing something like having a yearly withdrawl rate at retirement of over $100,000 for just those five years of effort. With this sort of benefit from compounding, you should view maxing out your IRA and 401k in your early twenties as a full time job, with frugality your programming language. Just by being frugal on a nice programmer's salary for four years starting at age 22 and putting your frugality efforts into maxing your IRA and 401k, you can almost guarantee a comfortable retirement. To ignore this math is foolish. With each dollar saved earning 32 times it's face value in your early twenties, which equates to $1.28 your yearly stipend at retirement assuming the 4% rule, budgeting and avoiding any and all unnecesarry purchases is crucial. To study frugality and becoming an expert, just like you studied computer science, is worth your time.

It's become a joke in personal finance to condemn every expense when you're young as being many times what it's worth, i.e. a cup of coffee costing you $128 dollars instead of $4 when you're 22, but there has to be an enlightened mindset that recognizes that yes, frivolous expenses when you're young _does_ explode! Maybe you should nix that Starbucks habit! Or better yet, avoid that student loan that's many tens of thousands of dollars (times THAT by 32!). Opportunity costs are just as real as any other financial mechanism. Realizing that when you're young is a tremendous blessing. Perhaps it can motivate you to study computer science using one of the affordable paths detailed on Holm School. Perhaps it will change you into an 'extremely' frugal person, when you grok that expenses are multiplied by 32. There are a lot of possibilities to discover related to this, but my hope with this blog is that you realize it at 18 instead of 35. By then, the equivalent amount of work you must pump into your investment vehicles are depressingly extreme. Do you want to be 'extreme' at 18, or 35? Either way, whether you procrastinate or whether you seize the opportunity index investing offers you at the start of your career, you'll have to behave in 'extreme' ways. People malign the FIRE movement for being extreme, but in my opinion it's just as extreme to ignore the rich opportunity compound interest offers you. Be extreme in a way that directly benefits you, instead of being extremely deprived!

Personal finance is a great hobby to have if you're a computer scientist. Just by doing a few nochalant tasks like reading Mr. Money Mustache or JL Collins, you can implement a saving and investing technique that enables luxuries like early retirement and carefree retirements. The return on investment learning how to code is equally matched by the return on investment regarding learning how to be financially independent. Take both opportunities that free internet resources offer, like [the free catalog of index fund books](https://holm.school/free-index-funds-books) and the [Holm School computer science curriculum](https://holm.school) to truly study ideas that are empowering and life enriching. This is the gift that the internet brings to every one of us. Don't squander your time by ignoring the opportunity. For just a few years of work and hard study when you're young, you'll have a lifetime of empowerment as you age.
I can attest, just by going to the local university in my hometown for two years and making copious use of the resources available at my public library and on github, I've turned my life around. Rather than working at Chipotle's for the rest of my life, I now am poised for a comfortable retirement. I hope it doesn't come off as bragging, instead I want to promote the rich opportunities that are available in your hometown as well as online. Most of us like to think that we're in an unfortunate position regarding where we were born, but a public library is an amazing place! Dreams can come true there. Unfortunately for many, it seems that it's [main competitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0), expensive colleges, are destroying dreams rather than enabling them. What a sorry circumstance, but education about education stands a chance of changing that ruthless victimization.

I'm sure you're heard the various quotes from Einstein and Buffet about the power of compounding, but find a way to incorporate its principles into your choices as a young programmer. Even some not-so-extreme 'extreme' choices like frugality can reward you handsomely for your sacrifices. You're either sacrificing when you're old or when you're young, and given that one circumstance requires you working until you're 70 and the other permits you to stop working at 40 and pursue your passions, I hope the stakes are self-explicating. The three factors in profit gains from investing are amount invested, time invested, and rate of return. Nixing things like rate of return by choosing hard-coded index funds and maxing out your 401k and IRA to hard-code amount invested, leaves you with just time invested as under your control. By living frugally even from a young age and avoiding the decadence of college will let you squidge that "time invested" amount to its maximum once you start your career as a programmer at 22. Even just seven years extra doubles your savings! Wow, how friggin important and crucial is that knowledge!?!?

It's especially infuriating to me when I take a look back at my life, and realize that I was programmed away from my interest in the stock market that developed during middle school and into the cult of anti-capitalism during my time at university pursuing a liberal arts bachelors degree. Perhaps if I could blame myself entirely for that programming, I wouldn't have much impetus to discuss it publically on something like a blog. However, anti-capitalism is rife within the liberal arts, and many students are right now studying it as assigned reading for their major. This kind of "indoctrination" is actually widespread in America, and it directly impacts students by making them second guess their interest in the stock market and investing. Rather than pursuing a well paying STEM degree in order to find full employability, even one that permits copious amounts of savings when coupled with some modicum of frugality, many students are enticed into spending some of their most valuable years studying what amounts to hot air. They don't find employability beyond minimum wage jobs. They don't change the world. They instead become brainwashed to hate America and resent the opportunities that are available, feeling that working towards revolution is more valuable than working a career. It's quite dismal, and that's why I was so thrilled while studying computer science to discover that learning programming is very easy outside the realm of the university. Why not kill two birds with one stone and undermine liberal arts departments while also empowering yourself career-wise and avoid programming by the anticapitalist cult-think. I honestly believe that the harm done to kids by liberal arts departments will have to be addressed at some point, and that's why I think Steven Pinker is so successful for example in "The Blank Slate", but I'm going to do my part by writing at Holm School. Knowing that investments double every seven-point-two years when invested in index funds truly changes your feelings of victimization by "America" and enables better understanding of the power of ideological cults to wreck lives. Avoiding university not only makes sense financially, but also in terms of avoiding life-altering wastes of time. There is no future in anticapitalism. Being a free market liberal is worth its weight in gold when you start living according to sound, peaceful, Enlightened, and democratic principles. Don't squander your life in a resentment-ridden ideological trashbin.

Being a moderate free market liberal isn't cool the day and age of Bernie Sanders, but the alternative is quite dire: waste the most valuable years of your life following a nihilistic philosophy that doesn't hold weight in the real world and throughout human history, and saddle yourself with the concomitant enormous student debt, the "badge" that you're properly brainwashed to resent America and democracy. It's a queer show that students take pride in the student debt they take on at 22, pursuing a non-existent career as a "liberal artist." Considering the [fundamental tenent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) of the "liberal" word behind "liberal artist" is free market capitalism and democracy, it's especially devastating that students ignore the roots of the trivium and quadrivium of education, in things like the Great Alexandrian Library or the Athenic gymnasium. Being a liberal doesn't mean one should never participate in anything deemed "capitalistic" or wealth-enabling like investing. What a sorry state of the world that that is what professors in academia teach in their curricula. That's why I hope you find resources like Holm School, Treehouse, and Mr. Money Mustache useful, and why I'm creating a virtual curriculum and blog around them.

Best of luck in your career as a self-taught programmer, and thank you for reading! Let me know your experiences about when you "grokked" compound interest, and what you did as a result.

## How to be a Vegan Straightedger

Go into the grocery store. Instead of buying animal products, buy whole food plant-based vegetables, beans, and milks and wean.

Go into the liquor store. Instead of buying beer, buy nonalcoholic beer and wean.

Go into the gas station. Instead of buying cigarettes, buy a zero nicotine vape and wean.

Go into the gas station. Instead of buying a zero nicotine vape, buy candy cigarettes and wean.

Go into the grocery store. Instead of buying champagne, buy a 2L bottle of Diet Mt. Dew and some orange juice and make Diet Mt. Dew mimosas and wean.

Go into the grocery store. Instead of buying beer, buy bottles of diet Root Beer and wean.

Go into the grocery store. Instead of buying a 12-pack of beer, buy a 12-pack of Diet Dr. Pepper and wean.

Go the the grocery store. Instead of buying coffee, buy decaf and wean.

Go to your Instagram. Instead of posting pictures of you drinking wine post pictures of you drinking fruit juice and wean.

Go to your Instagram. Instead of posting posts about your BBQ, post posts about your vegan pizza party and wean.

Go to your pizza parlour. Instead of buying pizza, buy a cheeseless pizza with vegetables -- or maybe even vegan cheeze if you're lucky -- and wean.

Go to your smoking spot. Instead of bringing a cig, bring a cup of ice water and wean.

Go to your back porch. Instead of bringing a cigarette, bring a bowl of microwaved frozen corn and sriracha. Wean.

Go to your YMCA. Instead of going to a bar, go to the ping pong table with your friends.

Go to your cigarette pack. Crush it in your hand, soak it under the faucet, and throw it away. Wean.

Go to your non-nicotine-free vape. Take out the nicotine cartridge, throw it away, and replace it with a zero nicotine cartridge and wean.

Go outside for a run. Take advantage of the health and stamina that comes from not smoking anything and build up your endurance until you're running 40 miles a week. And wean.

Stop drinking on the weekends and wean. Take advantage of the mental health that comes from not pickling your brain while it's still developing up until you're 25. Find ways to be the life of the party without resorting to drinking. Wean from your past destructive habits.

Invest the money you save not being addicted to a psychoactive in Vanguard index funds. Promote vegan straightedge to your party buds. Break the tyranny of the drug and alcohol companies on American youth culture. Buy the placebo and wean, and save the money for your education.

I promise it's worth it. We're in it for the long game. Saving $10 on a twelve pack for the weekend compounds to $4.4 up to $15 a year in perpetuity at retirement depending on whether you're 22 or 34 years old (use the rule of 72 at 10% interest multiplied by a 4% withdrawal rate: [($10 * 2^((60-22)/(72/10)) * .04] == $15 a year in perpetuity at retirement when you're 22, dwindling down to [($10 * 2^((60-34)/(72/10)) * .04] == $4.4 dollars a year in perpetuity at retirement if you skip the beer when you're 34). Do that for 52 weekends in a single year when you're young and you've paid for your two one-pound bags of lentils per week lunch in retirement in perpetuity, if not a homemade vegan dinner too. I'd rather eat lunch and possibly dinner all-expenses-paid in perpetuity in retirement than blitz through a twelve pack on the weekend partying when I'm young. At least I won't starve. The math doesn't add up on partying using psychoactives (of which there is no non-addictive psychoactive). Pay for your lentils in perpetuity during retirement by partying sober when you're young and investing the savings.


## How I Invest as a Computer Scientist

I'm just going to break down what my current method of attack for saving is. This is personal, but it might give someone new to being a frugal computer scientist an idea of how it breaks down month to month.

At the moment, I am maxing out my 401k. I tell my HR department, through a website, that I want to spend $19,000 on my 401k per year. That's the IRS maximum amount for 2019. It automatically divides that number by the number of pay periods I have. I get paid every other week, so that translates into roughly $689.62 going into my 401k. This is pretax money, so I don't have to pay taxes on it. It also lowers my yearly salary, so my tax bracket is lower for the part that I do pay taxes. It also compounds tax-free, I don't have to pay capital gains on it, but I do have to pay taxes when I withdrawal at age 59.5+. I have the option of getting a Roth 401k, where I pay post-tax money but don't have to pay taxes upon withdrawal.

My employer matches a maximum 5% of my salary. This is about $105.77 per two weeks. I vest every year 20%, so in a month when I've been at my job one year, I will vest 20%. Each year after that will be an additional 20%, up to 100% vestment in four more years. Of course, I am 100% vested on the $19,000 I put in every year, so that's safe and sound in perpetuity.

My 401k is broken down into three Vanguard funds: VFIAX (S&P500), Medium Cap (VIMAX), and Small Cap (VSMAX). [I put them in in a ratio defined by JL Collins: ~81% Large cap, ~6% Mid cap, ~13% Small cap. This is approximately the ratios of VTSAX](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/02/stocks-part-xvii-what-if-you-cant-buy-vtsax-or-even-vanguard/). I have all Vanguard cap funds I need to recreate VTSAX, but not actual VTSAX in my 401k, so this is the second best thing. Investing 100% in the S&P500 returns results similar to VTSAX over many decades too, so in my former job I was in the S&P500 index. Since they are actually Vanguard funds in my current 401k, I only pay 0.05-0.08% expense ratio, which is quite amazing in an 401k. My 403b at TIAA-CREF I paid 0.3% E/R for the S&P500 fund.

Along with the maxed-out 401k, I also max out a Vanguard Traditional IRA. The maximum value for a IRA is $6000 per year. This is pre-tax money, I take it out of my taxes when I file each year, so again this reduces my marginal tax rate bracket by another $6k on top of my $19k from my 401k. This also compounds without having to pay capital gains, in return for paying marginal taxes at withdrawal at 59.5+. With an IRA you have greater control over the portfolio selection since you choose where to open it. I chose Vanguard because of the low E/R and the VTSAX fund, which I learned about through [JL Collins's Stock Series](https://www.jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series). My E/R is 0.04%. I front-load my tIRA by buying all $6000 of VTSAX as early in the year as I can. Usually this is the first week of January, once the markets open after New Year's. [Front-loading is a good tactic if you can save up a few months ahead of January, as getting a longer time in a rising market each year over the decades helps final returns by around 6%.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzDwXdynFQe/)

That takes care of my tax-advantaged accounts. For my post-tax investments, I have a Vanguard brokerage account. Every time my bank account exceeds $3000 of my average monthly expenses, I put $1500 into my Vanguard brokerage account, buying VTSAX. I also have an second bank account with $3000 dollars, which is there for dipping into if I ever exceed that $1500 buffer in my primary bank account. So far I haven't had to. That gives me basically a $4500 emergency fund. That is plenty in Topeka, something around 5 months of expenses. I keep my emergency fund extremely low because my monthly expenses are very stable since I don't buy anything beyond whole food plant-based groceries, car payments, rent, internet, and utilities. As [Mr. Money Mustache says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFpJrqp0l_4), once you get into the hang of things, emergency funds don't need to be excessive. As a post-tax brokerage account, I pay capital gains tax each year on my earnings. This is very easy, as Vanguard generates a form that you just print off and include in your tax filings, and then copy the value it says into a little form box on TurboTax.

In November I stop putting money into my brokerage account so that I can save up the $6000 to front-load my IRA come the first week of January. I realize you could front-load your 401k, and I did that this year since the market was so low for the first few months, in which I put 100% of my paycheck into my 401k, but until further market corrections happen, I have my 401k on autopilot. I also realize you could set Vanguard up for autopayments into my brokerage account, but my $1500 "whenever I can" seems to work just fine. Honestly it takes me about 5 minutes to purchase, so I'm not urgently needing to automate that.

I never sell my shares. I am 100% buy and hold forever, as articulated by [John Bogle in his books](https://holm.school/free-index-funds-books). My brokerage Vanguard account acts as an additional emergency fund, given that it would take just a day to liquidate stock if I needed to get additional money for an emergency. But otherwise, my plan is to save up enough in my savings accounts that I can [make a Roth IRA conversion ladder](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/) when it's time to early retire. Ideally I would be able to [live off my post-tax account until I turn 59.5 and can use my tax-advantaged accounts](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/11/29/how-to-retire-forever-on-a-fixed-chunk-of-money/). Fortunately my cost of living is very low living in Kansas, so my yearly expenses are comparatively small and so my [4% Rule amount](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/) is very small too. I imagine I am 8 years away from financial independence, if I wanted to live in an apartment here in Topeka for the rest of my life.

My expenses are so low because I literally just read free books on the internet in my spare time. I use Library Genesis and a seven year old iPad. I bought a new laptop this year, because my old one was 11 years old, but beyond a car payment and living and food expenses, I don't spend a cent on restaurants or bars. My educational expenses are 100% covered by my public libraries (Treehouse, Lynda, O'Reilly Online, Kanopy) and employer (PluralSight). I get tuition reimbursement, which I am going to use next semester to get a CS degree from UoPeople free. Then I'm going to get an OMSCS degree. I bring my lunch every day to work (lentils or beans), and eat vegan dried goods for dinner too, since beans and lentils have the highest protein for vegans anyway. It comes to about 25 cents for each 350g lunch of lentils I eat (not including cooking cost), or about $2 for lunch per week. Beans or tofu and rice for dinner and oatmeal for breakfast is also cheap. Almost everything vegan is palatable thanks to Sriracha.

I've been frugal ever since I began working as a programmer three years ago, and when I turn age 35 next year I'll be about a year off from [my goal of saving 2x my salary by 35](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-save-double-your-salary-or-more-for-retirement-by-age-35-2018-05-16). Being frugal is a pleasure since the reward of early retirement, when I can study computer science and start businesses, is worth the present-day sacrifices. Considering how much free entertainment and education there is on the internet and at your public library, I literally feel no deprivation. In fact, I'm usually overwhelmed since there is so much I can read or study and so little time during the after-work hours. My savings rate the two years I was in New York was 50% (aided by living downtown and walking to my job and only filling with gas three times the entire time I lived there), and my current savings rate the past year in Topeka is around 60%. I am doing some things to boost my savings rate that most people wouldn't do, such as living at home to compensate for having to buy a car this year, but once I pay it off next month I anticipate being able to boost my saving rates to around 80%. All in all, I feel like the things I've learned through Mr. Money Mustache, Treehouse, and JL Collins have enabled me to recuperate from the financial disaster of getting an expensive liberal arts degree a few months before the great recession and facing many years of unemployment. I obviously live a weird life that sure as hell isn't ideal or a blueprint for everyone, but "crises precipitate change." I still have many years to go until I fully recuperate and can chill a bit, but the important thing is I have a effective strategy to get back on track. I have turned my life from an utter disaster full of mediocre-to-poor decisions into something with which I can at least work with and mitigate. And it cost very little to correct financially-speaking, thanks to affordable public and online education, it just took a couple of years of concerted hard work and study. It's not a roaring success that'll get me in the headlines any time soon, but for me it's progress towards my goals I want for my life.

That's how I invest as a computer scientist. I learned most of this in a period of a year by reading the recommended [personal finance books available free on the HolmSchool/free-index-funds-books repo](https://holm.school/free-index-funds-books).

## Computer Science Open Educational Resources In 2018

One of the most pressing questions facing young computer scientists is whether they are going to go into debt studying computer science. College is a wonderful experience but increasingly that experience is being paywalled behind exorbitant tuition fees and housing costs. What used to be accessible and provide a quality life experience is no longer affordable to lower class computer scientists. It is a shame that science is being hidden behind paywalls, in which quality education can only be experienced by going deeply into debt. Fortunately computer science usually has a good return on investment compared to other fields like the liberal arts, in which people go more than a hundred thousand dollars in debt sometime to study for few jobs in the long run. Computer science, however, is an inventor's daydream and many quality products have been invented that address the cost of a computer science education. In fact, I would have to say that at present, there is no reason to go into debt to study computer science. My budget to study computer science is currently $200 a year, and that's as a direct result of the benefit of having a paying computer science job. Let me explain how computer science has solved the dilemma of having to pay for a computer science education.

Open source programming has had many positive effects on society. The affordability of creating software due to open source has allowed new inventions and products to flood the market that improve our lives all while keeping costs low thanks to open source technology. Open source technology is often thought of as simply a software, but did you know that there are also open source books? Just as code is available for copying and distribution, there are computer science books that are available for copying and distribution for free! The authors of these books are people who have been influenced by open source as an ideology, and they have extended the copyrights found in software to cover books and educational technology. Does it surprise you that people who invent open source technology often open source the educational guide that teaches you how to use their open source technology? Or create it yourself? Whether that surprises you or not, that is simply the fact facing students of computer science. Computer science, being the technology that invented open source software, is also the field which leads the pack in open sourcing books for study. Computer science is the easiest field to study for free. It is the most robust in its offerings and is the most thorough in creating quality educational resources for students. If you are studying computer science and not taking advantage of these free open source books and videos, you are simply hurting yourself. To reject free resources in order to appease the traditions inherent in academia is a cult-like devotion that isn't necessarily bad in and of itself, however it will certainly hurt your wallet. Whether you feel your money is better kept in your own account or someone else's is a question only you can decide. If you are willing to embrace the future and study computer science using open education resources, you will find that a quality education can still be yours while saving tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. OER doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice collegiality as a whole. There are many ways (some as simple as joining a makerspace or hanging out at your local college library even if not a student) that will keep you experiencing life as a young person.

The goal, therefore, is a college equivalent experience for free or as cheap as possible. If you need help on figuring out why frugality is a value worth cultivating in general, I suggest reading some frugality blogs and how one benefit includes early retirement. It's hard to explain why OER is a worthwhile path to self betterment if you aren't on board with frugality. I am basically telling you that, instead of paying full price for designer clothes, you go to the thrift store and buy the same designer clothes for $5 instead of $50. If that somehow offends your sensibilities, I will probably never convince you of the ability to get a college-equivalent education using OER. If you are someone that buys designer clothes, designer cars, designer computers, or designer foods, then you are going to be a difficult individual to convince to skip the designer colleges. If you find yourself in this mindspace and don't want to be anymore (perhaps you're always in debt, have loans and credit card bills, or never have any equity or savings), then the only thing I can tell you is to google search "frugality blogs" and start living according to the frugality tips you'll find as a means of paying your debts and building up your savings. The funny thing is how little sacrifices are actually required. You'll still wear the same designer clothes, only you'll purchase them slightly used instead of new. You'll still drive an automobile, only it will be a used model purchased for $9,000 instead of a new model purchased for $35,000. You'll still eat well, only it will be beans and lentils and vegetables you cook yourself instead of lunches at restaurants. If living frugally is somehow a problem for you, then you'll need to begin a full-hearted exploration of frugality in modern times and why you would want to live debt-free in the first place. If frugality is something we can agree on and you already put into daily practice, then keep reading and learn about how to frugally become a computer scientist.

Living frugally doesn't mean you live the same as a big spender. Used designer clothes will never be as nice as new designer clothes. But what comes with frugality is the power to use your prefrontal cortex and analyze the disparities and come to the conclusion, "slightly used designer clothes that I purchase for $5 at the thrift shop are not really that much different from new designer clothes, especially to justify ten times the expense." Are clothes from the thrift shop ten times as used? No, they are often barely even worn. In much the same way you are going to have to use your prefrontal cortex to analyze whether a brick and mortar college is really that much different than online study, especially to justify fifteen to twenty-five times the expense. And this isn't fifteen times $5, but fifteen times thousands of dollars. The stakes are much higher. And playing with something with such high stakes should send alarm bells off in your head. Does reading books really require spending thousand of dollars? If you've spent your whole life going to the public library to read for free, you might be a little flabbergasted to learn that at age eighteen the free book train ends and instead you suddenly have to go hundreds of thousand of dollars into debt just to continue reading books. Why does it cost so much to read books? Are the books really that rare in college, or more valuable? Are textbooks really so amazing that they justify spending hundreds of dollars, on top of tuition, in order to read and discuss them? Those warning bells going off in your heads should be heeded. College textbooks sound a lot like designer clothes, don't they? While library books sound like the good ole $5 thrift store clothes (same brand, just slightly used instead of new). But supposedly along with the responsibilities of turning 18 is the responsibility to use that credit card and take out a huge loan to start buying designer textbooks and classes. Maybe you're power tripping a bit when you decide to go to that private college, just like when instead of going to the public library for a book you go to Barnes and Noble. Maybe you've fallen for the bait that part of being an adult is to get yourself into debt as quickly as possible. Maybe you think reading public library books if for little children, or not-smart people. There are a lot of self doubts that add up to you signing up for a non-defaultable loan worth tens of thousands of dollars at the age of 18, without even a job.

I'm going to make an observation of a trend much in line with Moore's Law: As much as college tuition increases from year to year, the quality of free computer science OER increases too from year to year. That is, as tuition for a computer science degree at brick and mortar schools increases, the quality of education you can receive from free OER resources improves just as much. That's because people who would normally be devoting their life work to improving the college experience for paying students are now putting their effort towards improving OER. This might befuddle you at first, because the economics just don't make sense. How can you improve upon a product that returns nothing on the investment? But OER does make return on investment, it teaches more people to be computer scientists and those people in turn become developers that create new technology that improves the lives of everyone in the world. Computer Science is not zero sum, the more quality computer scientists in the world the better the world becomes. Adding new computer scientists does not decrease the quality of life for existing computer scientists. Teaching kids how to become computer scientists for free does not threaten the financial well-being of a professional computer scientist. In fact, it increases the job opportunity as those new computer scientists invent new technologies that create new jobs. Computer scientists know this more than any other profession, and that's why computer science invented open source. Open source promotes the view that CS education is not zero sum. If you can grasp this notion, then you are much more willing to trust in the effort of OER authors to create a world in which a world class computer science education is available for free to anyone. I and many other people share that goal, because we are convinced the world where such an education is possible is better than a world where it is not. And having that trust in OER has the potential to greatly improve your life, because it will keep you away from the monster that is student debt.


My next angle of attack in convincing you to use OER is the notion that OER texts are just as good as those $150 textbooks that keep getting assigned for intro classes. Again, it's easy to default to my usual argument that textbooks are designer clothes while OER are thrift store clothes. Same brand, just slightly used. If used clothes give you the heebie-jeebies, you might need more convincing that new clothes aren't worth ten times the expense. But if you're on board, let me share my enthusiasm that there is plenty of OER to do the duty of teaching you the equivalent of those costly freshman textbooks. Especially considering OER is free while a textbook will set you back the equivalent of twenty hours of minimum wage labor. For the cost of a single textbook for a semester-long class, you could buy an ipad on which to read free OER for years to come. Your ibooks app could be flush with OER, teaching you multiple programming languages and most computer science concepts. You could program on a $35 raspberry pi, and keep the total cost of an undergraduate degree $250 for hardware plus internet costs. Considering college costs more than $60,000, you have to ask yourself if you would rather spend $500 for hardware or $60,000 for college tuition (120 times the expense). If you take the time to read some recommended OER, I think you'll discover that OER meets educational requirements, especially when the more inexpensive option would require 67 hours of labor at minimum wage and the more expensive would require 8040 hours). That's basically less than two weeks of labor versus 201 weeks (four years) of labor. I would rather work two weeks to fund my computer science education rather than four years. But if "used clothes" disgust you, I'll never convince you that OER represents the same quality as designer clothes for a fraction of the cost. At which I would refer to you the significant improvement in life that could come from working two weeks instead of four years. Get over that disgust of buying used clothes if it means you'll have four years of free time. Get over the disgust of not having a bricks and mortar college degree if it means you'll have the equivalent of four years of free time, while maintaining the same level of education and learning.

But let's explore that disgust reaction. I'm willing to admit that it seems like a logical reaction when approaching OER for the first time. That because of a combination of multiple factors. The first is because of something I call the fallacy of the used science textbook. When people hear about free textbooks, they usually recall their empirical experience of seeing a used science textbook in the used bookstore. An example would be an anatomy textbook from 1973, which is for sale at the used bookstore for $4. While this textbook was obviously a quality college-level product in 1973, one in which the original owner probably paid a hefty sum, the price tag of $4 justifies that observation that many of the facts in the book are probably outdated and it certainly lacks all new discoveries in anatomy made since 1973. You pay $4 for a textbook, but get an outdated product. So when people initially encounter a $0 ebook, they automatically assume it's half a decade out of date. But that disgust and skepticism to OER fails to account for a couple of mitigating differences. The first is that OER is an ebook, it is not in paperback form. Ebooks are a new experience to many people. The ipad has only been out for ten years and before that no one was patient enough to read 350 page pdfs on a laptop. People simply aren't aware of the technology, and they are equating it with it's previous incarnation of paperback books, a wholly different technology. When more people become acquainted with ebooks, they will begin to understand why free is a justifiable pricetag-- there is no production cost. The second difference is that OER has an open source license. Having open source licenses attached to book means a book no longer risks going out of date. Other doctors can follow up with the original anatomy textbook and fork their own book, which they can make updates to and again publish their updated textbook as a free OER ebook. Open licenses allow for reproduction as well as modification of the original book, allowing an important textbook to never go out of date as long as there are willing maintainers (even if the original author quits or dies). Since web hosting is free, the OER will always be accessible to anyone interested in learning from any number of legacy maintainers. That anatomy textbook doesn't have an open source license, and that's why it's sitting in the used bookstore for $4. OER is not like that $4 anatomy textbook from 1973 afterall. That's the power of open source licensing permitting derivatives of the work. If it were OER, you can guarantee it or a derivative of it would be available for free somewhere on the internet, fully updated with modern information. OER is completely new technology compared to paperbacks and is destined to permit frugal studying for anyone with an internet connection. You should not be disgusted by $0 open-license textbooks, but infinitely fascinated and inspired. And convinced just a little that this new technology might just nullify the need for the high cost of CS degrees from brick and mortar colleges.


There is nothing in this for me. I don't gain anything by having you skip college and study online. But as someone that spent $8k getting enough CS education to get my first job, after researching it more I came to the conclusion that I could have gotten that job for much much less money. And as someone with a disability who has not been able to work before learning CS, the money is very very important to me because I have so little of it. I've now committed to not spending any money on computer science education and only using free resources online. I spent $200 on pluralsight the past year, but I have barely used it compared to the amount I have spent instead working on Treehouse and Lynda which are provided free through my public library. Next year I will spend $0 on computer science education. Does that mean I'm not a computer scientist? Hardly, I spend more time than ever studying programming. I am more skilled than I ever have been, though I am spending less money than I ever have in the past on learning programming. I am convinced that spending money on a computer science education is not a solution to any of my problems. I am convinced that affording a down payment on an inexpensive home is my most pressing problem, and the money I save studying computer science for free online is enough, when combined with my frugality, to save money for that purpose. Because I have no debt from college, I am able to save up enough for a down payment in just two years of employment. I have zero debt because I have never spent on credit. I save 55% of my after-tax earnings. If I had cheaper housing than what I have at the moment, I would raise that even further. Many frugality bloggers save 70% or more. These goals don't afford a lot of room for education. But fortunately, at the end of the day after work I don't really have that much time to devote to education anyway; just a few hours at most. For someone employed, the resources provided by my public library and OER suffice for any professional development I might need. My goal at the moment is saving for a down payment on a small house, and the only thing that interferes with that goal is my team's weekly lunch at the Indian buffet (and $11 a week isn't that bad). Everything else is streamlined for savings: no driving except to the store, no non-library books except for pluralsight (which I'm not going to continue after December), beans and lentils everyday for lunch and dinner. It's not glamorous by any means, but I accomplishing my goal of saving significant money.

All of this is a bit tangential to OER, but discussions of frugality need to be inspired by open source licensing more than they currently do. There are significant savings to someone who becomes "literate" to OER and free online educational curriculums like MOOCs. You get hired by having a good resume, and you get a good resume by spending the time doing tutorials on programming languages and frameworks. You can significantly increase the amount of time you have doing those tutorials if you aren't having to work a student job to pay for your tuition at a college.

When I was a senior in high school, my teacher had me read "Colleges That Change Lives" as a way of introducing me to the notion of not engaging with the competitivity of college admissions/rankings. I'm glad she did, because I ended up saving a lot of money going to a smaller, less competitive liberal arts school and I also made a great bunch of friends. Although the school didn't have a computer science department, which obligated me going back to school at my hometown  college in order to learn object-oriented programming, I still managed to gain a lot from excusing myself from the rat race that competitive colleges engender. I would like Holm School to be the sort of "Colleges That Change Lives" for computer science students. If you want to change your life and avoid the beast that is student debt, acquainting yourself with OER and online education is a great way to let yourself develop to be the type of person you want or dream to be. Free CS education from my public library allowed me to get a job after two years of studying CS (though I've been coding since sixth grade). The money I saved by using my public library, coupled with those cheap local college classes, permitted me to begin saving towards a home much faster than if I had ever gone to a private college and majored in CS. If you are interested in frugality, which DOES apply to computer science education, you should not only read "Colleges That Change Lives" but also contribute to the Holm School community, whether by use of the social features or by directly contributing code and OER recommendations. If your goal is to change your life for the better through studying computer science, I firmly believe OER is the most likely path to enable your success. If you come to the conclusion, as I have, that brick and mortar university are never a solution to any problem encountered by a computer science student and should be avoided at all costs (except for when they're full-ride, or they're extremely affordable and you don't go into debt for them), then Holm School has met its goals as an educator about CS education.

## Competing Models of Education: The University versus the Public Library


There are two competing models of what higher education should look like: the university model and the public library model. The opening salvo of the war between the two institutions could perhaps be seen as the widespread popularity of the 1997 film "Good Will Hunting" and it's infamous bar scene ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0)). A $150,000 Harvard education versus a $1.50 public library education doesn't just explain itself in its relation to access to books: it is a competition of ideologies. Even modern digital video tutorials on computer science can be accessed for free through your public library's Treehouse or Lynda subscriptions. When supplemented with the free computers available at the public library as well as their collection of programming books in the stack, everything that is required to become a computer scientist is available for free through your public library. Why spend $4000 on a University of the People education when you could get the equivalent for $4 in late charges at your public library?

The success of the public library model is built into the system itself: Whereas to make itself more affordable to compete with free online learning, colleges are going to have to start using OER as course textbooks. But OER don't require being "subscribed" to your local college to access them. ANYONE on the internet can access free OER. OER is basically the public library model applied to ebooks - the OER book is permanently in a public library and never as a result of paying tuition fees to a college. Why spend $4000 on a University of the People degree that uses OER when you can just look at their syllabus and read the OER required, for free, on the internet? That's the magic of the copyleft license -- all derivative works are required to be free and copyleft licensed too. That way no one can monetize the public library model. OER is the result of the author permanently dedicating their work into a global public library. Because there is no global electronic public library, OER is the license that ensures for its equivalence. Dedicating a work to an OER license places that book in a free, global, electronic public library for the rest of eternity. OER operates on the public library model, not the college model. To quote Matt Damon, why pay $150 for a textbook when you could have read the equivalent for $0 on your OER public library laptop?

UoPeople is proof that the public library model is the future of education in the twenty-first century. In fact, University of the People has built into the ability to incorporate the public library model. Just like Treehouse has a $300-a-year subscription but is available for free to patrons if your public library pays for its service, UoPeople could easily exchange free student enrollment for library patrons if the library pays for its service fee. Though perhaps this won't happen with UoPeople, it is inevitable this will happen with a similar social justice university program and that within a decade you will be able to get an online degree for free through your public library. In that very true sense, the public library model wins. Free college education will not take place in community colleges or public universities. The very nature of those programs is the subscription model where students pay a subscription fee to participate and study. The public library model where the public library pays for the student's subscription fee is the future of free college education. Even though this will happen in the future, there is a benefit in that you don't have to wait for the future to reap the benefits of the success of the public library model. You can go down to your public library right now and learn to program for free. You might not get a degree -- yet -- but you'll still know how to program when it's time to find employment. You won't be serving fries, you'll be a professional computer scientist that gets tuition reimbursement through her job so that you can get a degree for free while working. With the public library model, there is a lifetime of free computer science education as opposed to four years of astronomic, soul-crushing debt. Being frugal and financially independent is a result of a personal pact to never taking on debt in any form and never spend money that you don't have. And avoiding debt by using public library resources is the easiest way to preserve financial independence. To participate in the college model instead of the public library model is to invite disaster upon your house just like using credit cards. Because the credit card industry makes money when you can't control your impulses and put things on credit. And the university industry makes money when you can't control your impulses and put subscription fees to educational lectures on credit.

Do you still buy music CDs? No? Why not? Because Spotify is $10 a month. Should you still buy university lectures? No! Why not? Because educational lectures are available for free on your public library's electronic subscription to Lynda and Treehouse or in their book stacks. Are CDs any cheaper now that Spotify has been invented? No, they are still $10-15 on Amazon. And the case is the same for university lectures. They are no cheaper even though YouTube has been invented. Heck, vinyl records still sell for $20-30. Just because they are still selling CDs and Vinyl records in the store doesn't mean they are still the best option for listening. They are there because the infrastructure is still in place for their creation. The printing presses didn't shut down completely. Just like the university lecture halls haven't been foreclosed upon. There are still people buying these old technologies. And that's fine. It makes no difference to me if you prefer vinyl, I use to in my younger days. But to suggest that purchasing vinyl is mandatory for all music listeners and no other formats should be used is silly, and that's basically what universities are attempting to pull with the success of the public library model. Sorry, I am going to listen to Apple Music for $10/month and have access to every song ever written. And sorry, I am never going to take on debt to listen to an educational lecture when they are available for free as OpenCourseWare on YouTube or as a unit on Treehouse or Lynda. Although there is no doubt that vinyl is a lot cooler than mp3, if I were to pursue building a music library in vinyl or CD that is equivalent to my collection on Apple Music, I would go broke. And my pursuit of education also has to be frugal and make some sacrifices. Though university is cool as hell, it like vinyl has to be moved on from and appreciated as a really cool era in history that forever changed the world. But it cannot be seen as a sustainable future given all that I am up against in the world. I demand streaming in compressed format, so that I can conserve my networking costs while at the same time having the ability to consume the lecture anywhere I am at the moment, not just from a preordained lecture hall. I don't need a subscription for $1000 a month when my public library subscription is $0 a month. I'd simply rather not labor to pay that subscription fee when I can be frugal. Just like I don't buy goods on credit, I don't buy books and lectures on credit. Just like the mp3 was invented to move on from CDs, the public library now subscribes to college-equivalent computer science lectures as a way to move on from university. There are benefits and costs. But ultimately I appreciate listening to any song ever written on Apple Music for $10 a month. It's just a really good service. And the public library model is a really good service in that sense. It will take you to your life goals in a much more frugal way than spending on credit ever will. Being financially independent means having the self control to only use a debit card and never use a credit card.

The public library model is the forbearer of open source programming. Just like linux was committed to the GPL license, so too books are committed at your local library to be freely available to any patron for as long as the book is on the shelf. The public library never charges a subscription fee, unlike the university model, so there is a low barrier of entry to everyone in the community. There are no age restrictions on the public library model, so you can become a programmer at any age as opposed to just 18-22. The university model is flawed because it relies on credit -- in fact, it makes money off the student buying its product on credit -- so there will always be incentive to hurt you as much as possible. The university model has passwords on its wifi, as opposed to the public library open access hotspots. The university model charges subscription fees to its electronic resources, as opposed to the free electronic resources with the public library model. The public library model hurts very few people with debt -- maybe $1.50 in late charges -- while the university model has no qualms about saddling a patron with $150,000 debt at the drop of a hat. If you are committed to frugality, there is more return on investment with going with the open source public library model instead of the university model. Frugality makes some sacrifices, sure, no one's denying that. But living your life with the principle of never purchasing something on credit can leave you stress free and prosperous.

I would not bet my money on the successful re-adaptation of the university model. Exclusivity is built into its very foundation as a model of education. It cannot exist without high subscription fees. If you truly think it can, then you are welcome to place your money where your allegiance lies. But if you examine the university model in comparison to the public library model, you will see that the open source inheritance is where it is going to succeed for the sake of its patrons. OER is just a hint of the prosperity that results from the sweet combination of electronic resources with built-in zero cost. Open source is possible because of the internet, and free university education is possible because of public libraries. Just the simple existence of interlibrary loans should give you serious pause about the ability of a library to replace a university lecture. Why pay $150 for a textbook when you can get it free through interlibrary loans? Why pay UoPeople $4000 to read OER when you can read OER for free? The university model sinks into the past while the public library model flies into the future. Don't find yourself living with the repercussions of betting on the wrong model. The results could be tragic and costly. Get your public library on board with Treehouse and Lynda as a way to augment their computer science stacks and you will find yourself with multiple lifetimes of programming tutorials. The lessons available with just those two subscriptions are enough to provide years of training and self-education. I've been using Treehouse for four years through my public library and I'm only halfway through the curriculum. Lynda supplements this nicely by having a ton more of programming lessons. This doesn't even take into consideration the massive amounts of free CS OER available, as documented by this website's curriculum. I have more to study than I could ever hope to accomplish, and the many lifetimes of work is completely free. I would have to be ridiculously careless to ever enroll in a master's or PhD program for tuition. Why take off time from work to earn a certificate that I don't even need? It won't ensure any more success for as much as it would cost. People always say spend money on education but they don't have the education about education to know how easy it is to find meaningful but frugal OER on computer science. All this is possible through open source licensing and the internet. For sure I'm on board. I'm paying $45 a month in my high speed cable bill for it. Why waste it? I have a public library card. Why waste it?


## An Introduction to Open Education

Open Education is a bit of a Frankenstein creation of computer science that is affecting the education system. It derived from computer science because it is the application of open source licensing to educational resources. It is having interesting results (sometimes frustrating slow results, however), and as I have worked the past two years on EdTech teaching computer science to K-12 students and now have a side hustle github project that focuses on CS OpenEd, I'd like to take this Code Topeka blogpost as an opportunity to discuss a 101-level introduction to Open Ed to anyone who doesn't know how open source licensing is affecting education today.

Open source licensing usually refers to any software project that makes its source code available to read. There are different levels of open sourcing, from the most restrictive to the most permissive, such as letting you copy the source code as long as a similar open source permissive copyright is used by your project ("copyleft") to letting you use the source code even for commercial/non-open source use as long as the permissive copyright is included somewhere in your source (MIT License). There is usually an open source license for whatever permissiveness you're looking to grant. This github repo is an "unlicense" repo, which is basically public domain. That is the most permissive open source license. Whoever writes up a blog post on this Code Topeka blog will essentially be contributing to Open Ed by fact that their blog post will be made public domain for anyone to reuse and remix without restriction.

There are a different set of open source licenses for non-source code cultural artifacts. Those typcially use Creative Commons licenses. Creative Commons licenses are powerful because they allow CC books to be read and downloaded online for free while still protecting the rights requested by the author, while still being more permissive than copyright. Creative Commons licenses aren't used for source code, but do apply to books, music, and movies. They allow these realms to be "open sourced", allowing for remixing and reuse as well as free download. If you need a primer on Creative Commons license, I recommend [this video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZMPRymQsBw). When I was a musician in college, I released my music under the BY-SA (By/Attribute, Share Alike) license, which was equivalent to copyleft/GPL3.0. I've since public domained my music. I did this because I was into linux long before I got into making electronic music, so I knew about copyleft and wanted to work in the same domain of open source even though I wasn't programming source code, per se. CC allowed me to do this without just using "copyleft" and "anti-copyright." The "CC-BY" license is roughly equivalent to MIT license, and the "CC0" license is public domain.

Most of this got a huge kickstart in 2003 when MIT created its "OpenCourseWare" web page. Using realmedia videos, they hosted videos of their actual class lectures on their OCW website. The debt to open source licensing is obvious in their choice of name for the project: "Open course" instead of "open source." This was the first real initiative of an important player in postsecondary education to commit to creating open source educational resources. While the emphasis on the beginning was videos of lectures, which obviously has a high up-front cost (both for the video and audio equipment but especially in regards to hosting the video files in the days before YouTube), professors at even schools with small budgets eventually found the fundings to make their own OCW, especially after YouTube was invented and after the rapid advancement in digital cameras in the mid-2000s. There was a boom in OCW, and nearly the entire computer science curriculum was available (from prestigious universities) on YouTube by the late aughts. Of course, with the D.R.Y. principle you only need one version at a time, but multiple professors from multiple universities were uploading OCW every year, creating updated versions of their classes in near real time. Of course, the problem with OCW was that the textbook usually wasn't open source. That wasn't due to lack of availability -- there has for a long time been a robust offering of open source computer science textbooks, it's just that the professors weren't brave enough to choose these books for their classes. The creation of Creative Commons in the mid-2000s afforded a hope that OCW would be created that also used an open source textbook. This dream has been slow to be realized, with the stigma surrounding using open source textbooks as the core of the class and not just as a supplment, but [I am at the moment cataloging all OCW that also uses OER](https://github.com/HolmSchool/holm-school/OCW-that-uses-OER).

Eventually educators in other departments found these licenses and realized that a public domain of educational resources is a good thing to create, especially considering the potential cost savings to college students. This resulted in the creation of "Open Educational Resources" (OER) as a philosophy as well as the concomitant search engines and databases. This allows OER compilation websites to include download links on their OER databases to the actual book/textbook. OER is just taking off, but it's pretty exciting to be at the birth of a whole new form of open source technology and seeing the adoption in colleges and libraries. Of course, the irony of this is that OER is nothing new. Since computer scientists have been working in open source for decades, many computer scientists already had released their textbooks free online. Though they didn't use these new fangled CC licenses, they did write in their copyright the permissiveness they desired for their work while still releasing their creation for free download online. Many college professors did this, and it's always interesting to come across an old HTML webpage (without CSS, without images, using tables or something) on a college website linking to a full textbook in an important computer science concept. These books were previously hard to find, but now thanks to the crowd sourcing of sites like github, there are repositories centralizing an archive of "free" computer science textbooks. The main one at the moment is [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/), where there is a list of thousands of free computer science textbooks for download. It's sort of ironic to see other college departments play catchup as their professors for the first time in their life encounter open source. Whereas computer scientists have been publishing open source books for decades, CC-licensed books are getting published in other departments for the first time in just the past few years. And the numbers are paltry. The number of free textbooks in other departments (especially the liberal arts) in on the order of tens. Watching OER get released in non-CS departments is a sad affair. The professors are more resistant and stubborn, and view OER as a threat to their bottomline. As a result, OER, while being around for many years, still flounders in every department other than computer science. There are maybe a textbook or two for use in college classes, and usually only for introductory-level classes (see [OpenStax](https://openstax.org)). A robust public domain is a testament to the value of the field for society, rather than a testament to the value of the field for a select few with tenure.

As fortunate computer scientists, we can benefit directly while the other departments struggle just to get their professoriate to understand open source licenses, let alone take the plunge to release their textbooks using one. As the department that invented open source licenses for nearly all creative output (source code and cultural), these licenses' saturation and influence upon almost everything computer scientists do has created the unique situation that learning computer science has reached the point that an undergraduate education can be obtained for basically the cost of a cheap tablet and a Raspberry Pi. Since the suite of everything needed to code itself can be obtained for free using open source software, since the suite of everything need to allow yourself to code can be obtained for a couple hundred bucks using open source hardware, and the suite of everything needed to allow yourself to learn to code can be obtained for free thanks to OER and OpenCourseWare. It's never been easier to catalog new and innovative OER and OCW, as a Pull Request to a prominent github repo is all that's needed to add it to the catalog. Crowd sourcing thanks to github will continue to permit ease of access to OER. It's no longer the wild west out there, the infrastructure for this project is mature and finalized. It is up to computer scientists to promote this opportunity to new people in the field, as not many people uninvolved in computer science know about OER and OCW (although platforms like Khan Academy, Udacity, Coursera, edX, and other free MOOCs have saturated American educational culture in recent years).

Part of that will be teaching to students that Github offers educational opportunities outside of just source code. It's a good place to crowd source text documents including books, videos, and catalogs of books and videos, a task formerly dominated by wikis. Promoting Github as an important platform for everyone regardless of department will be a monument task, perhaps even foolhearty, but as a Github evangelist I think it is the best resource at this time for promoting Open Ed. Teaching Github competency should be done at the high school level, and everyone regardless of school or department should know how to maintain a repository. It is as important of a tool in a student's arsenal as a graphing calculator (also a tool with a strong learning curve, but completely worth it). Students should also be taught about open source licenses, so they know where and how to look on the internet for a free educational resource to download.

The funny thing about OER is that it takes an important principle of software development -- D.R.Y., or Don't Repeat Yourself -- and applies it to education. Instead of looking for market solution for a panoply of competing textbooks looking for future subscription fee earnings, it takes the cost of production of one book (just one book) and distributes it among philanthropists so that a professor can dedicate some of their free time to producing a textbook that is dedicated in the public domain. Once in the public domain, there is no need to produce any other similar textbook, because there is zero marketability when it comes to open source books. Instead, this one book can serve the entire world by being downloaded and used free via the internet. Rather than having thousands of professors writing the same textbook over and over trying to get new purchasers, they just create one textbook for use for the rest of eternity. Since it's open source, future updates can just be appended or integrated in the original document and its maintenance can be crowd sourced. This is D.R.Y. when it comes to education, and the immediate benefit to society is a completed oeuvre of public domain books that cover all the bases necessary for a college education in computer science. At which point future OER can be dedicated to media that aren't already covered, such as video lectures or software, etc. Do it once and do it well, then move on to the next gap for learners and fill the holes. It's like road repair work -- pretty boring, not particularly prestigious, but damn essential to the modern city. The former way of charging outrageous prices for college textbooks is dead, and the boom times are fortunately over for opportunistic textbook publishers and authors who could exploit a captive audience.

What's left for OER? Beyond fleshing out curricula in other departments, there is also on the horizon the future finalization and legalization for a "Spotify for Books." Once this product is offered on the market for a $15 a month subscription fee, the former way of going to college and earning a degree are probably over. For $180 a year you will be able to read every book available at your college's library's stack, thus making the need to enroll as a student just for access null. For pittance, all the world's books will be available at a pindrop through the app. Affordable and instaneous (and legal -- pirate book sites already affords this opportunity at the cost of not being legal), open education will be complete. As competiting services lower their prices and streamline their deliverables, public libraries will soon be able to pay for the "Spotify" service. All the world's books will be free for everyone in America through their public library. In my prediction this is only 10-20 years away, and the effects will be monument. Kids will be able to study what they want where and when they want, and costs will no longer be a factor in educational opportunity. OpenEd is a neat trick for the moment, but once we get an affordable "Spotify for Books" education as a practice as we know it will be forever changed. Then anyone can teach themselves what they want for free, without having to rely on trips to the public library or coughing up a hefty sum for college classes. I fully expect a future with ubiquitous free books, and every indication I'm finding while I research this points to it happening within our lifetimes. That, in my opinion, is the objective of open source and the internet: free books. It's taken a while but anyone who has participated in the realm of open source is excited to finally see the relaxation of copyright law's influence in American media finally be realized in the finalization of an app that serves every book every published for pittance. Maybe even the cost of a few ads occasionally.

At that point, online education will change to such a drastic degree that online universities will be able to trim their costs to such a radical degree that the cost for tuition will be able to be covered by philanthropy or else services such as a public library. The public library, for example, already covers the cost of Lynda for most everyone in the nation (and in Topeka we are lucky that the library also subscribes to Treehouse -- a $300 a year value). There already exist online B.S. degrees in computer science [that cost $4000 total](https://uopeople.edu) and master degrees [that cost $7000 total](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). When the cost of these colleges ($1000 a year at the moment) goes below what even Treehouse costs ($300 a year), public libraries will be able to subscribe on their patron's behalf and cover the cost of tuition thanks to a grant or philanthropic endowment. In my opinion, once ubiquitous free digital books happens in America, ubiquitous free college degrees in computer science will rapidly follow (thanks to your hometown public library). You won't be on the hook for college tuition anymore, your public library will pay for you. That's my prediction, we'll see in thirty years if I'm right or wrong. I suspect something similar, if not exactly this, will be common practice. I don't suspect people will be paying to study computer science, computer science will be so affordable that they're practically handing out computer science degrees for free like candy since the overhead of creating CS educational content has been crowd sourced thanks to OER and OCW. It's not a matter of opportunity, it's a matter of motivation for a student to _want_ to study computer science. Computer science _education_ is already free now, thanks to OER and OCW, and in the future computer science _degrees_ will also be free. It's a crazy world where you can get a B.S. in C.S. for $4000 in 2019. In thirty years, even that tuition will be seen as outrageous. People can learn computer science for free because people need to learn computer science in the twenty-first century, and the market meets demand. If you don't believe things are being turned upsidedown, just consider the fact that most future Microsoft technology will be open source. Microsoft is now an open source company. Open source is affecting everything in the world, not just computer software and hardware. It's a really good idea that was created because of the influence of networks and the internet. The internet isn't going anywhere, and neither are open source licenses.

I obviously write about education because I've worked in CS EdTech the past few years. Open Source licenses are affecting every field, not just education (although it looks like education is just about the second most impacted field next to computer science). Open source licensed media is going to work it's way down the creative industries of the world and soon be the defacto choice for copyright. I suggest you enter the world of open source by purchasing a Raspberry Pi, it's just $50 an allows you to explore a low-risk implementation of open source software and hardware. You can explore any topic that catches your fancy, but for now the most robust field for learning using open source media is computer science. Perhaps you could start an open source company or project on Github. Perhaps you could produce OER or OCW yourself. The sky's the limit once your costs are cut down to such a small degree that the need to earn a return on your investment is just a couple tens of bucks. That's what permits you to create open source works and to dedicate media to the public domain. The nice thing about open source is that it sort of acts as an passive and electronics-free Artificial Intelligence, instead of affecting a computer it affects human culture and society. The public domain is a worthy objective to aim your creative efforts towards. It sort of compounds on itself and instead of just rewarding you alone it rewards everyone in society. I'm obviously a bit on the edge when it comes to open source evangelism, but trust me that's from a position of knowledge as opposed to ignorance. If you aren't creating open source technology now, you are basically writing yourself out of the future. You might make a few more bucks in the meantime as a result of your choice, but you won't be influencing the future the same way that you would if you created open source media. That's just an opinion but again, all I point to is the fact that even Microsoft, yes Microsoft, is now an open source company. Open source is the future, proprietary media is not.

That's a lot of predicting of the future, but the immediate gain from the Open Education movement is the uncommonly-known fact that you can learn computer science for free, and soon that will also apply to other departments (first STEM departments, and then in the future liberal arts departments). This doesn't mean colleges are unnecessary, it just means that if you find yourself on the hook for a large debt you might be better off looking at alternatives. I think thanks to ubiquitous free digital books, public libraries will play an increasing role in future computer science education. The fact that the Topeka Public Library has a Treehouse subscription (in addition to Lynda) which is basically an undergraduate education in computer science for free, and you can "library card hop" from a Johnson County Public Library card (available to anyone in Kansas) to a Johnson County borrowers card at Mid-Continent Public Library (Kansas City), which affords you a free subscription to O'Reilly's Safari Books Online, just shows that as a Topekan you are able to get a vast amount of educational resources for free from local public library. That doesn't include their physical stacks nor the sheer amount of free OER and OCW online to add on top of that heap of resources. I know many of the current members of Code Topeka aren't interested in education anymore since they're established developers, but this blog post is for anyone in Topeka that is just starting out their computer science education. It also expands on what I'm researching and working on as a former EdTech developer and current github-based EdTech side hustler. My current project, [Holm School](https://github.com/HolmSchool/holm-school), attempts to curate the vast amount of OER and OCW into a bachelor's degree equivalent curriculum. I think at this point curation is needed more than contributing even more OER on top of what has already been curated. [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) is a nice repository to have, but to a newbie it is almost valueless since they don't even know where to start or how to choose the appropriate OER for their circumstances. I am also following other curations of OCW and OER in order to catalog their differing approaches for students' benefit](http://localhost:8000/computer-science/#further-studies).

I love EdTech and am excited I can use my knowledge of open source from working in open source for more than twenty years. EdTech isn't the only solution to problems such as excessive student debt, but curated appropriately it can certainly be a huge benefit to students' bottom line. I myself benefitted immensely from studying CS at Washburn for two years, but I also benefitted immensely from studying Treehouse at the same time through the Topeka public library. I think I successfully navigated the treacherous terrain that is modern college education in CS, in that I got out with a job as soon as possible for just a small initial investment, while also supplementally educating myself at the public library as well as using free OER and OCW. It was so successful in my own experience that I'm now starting a nonprofit in order to teach OER/OCW and public library's benefit to others too. If you ever want to talk about computer science education (K-12 or postsecondary), let me know. I think I'm probably the only person in Code Topeka that's worked on EdTech as a job, so I just wanted to share in a blog post what I've learned about current technology and future innovations. Getting a college education in computer science for just a couple thousand bucks is a neat trick, but I hope in the future that this trick isn't just available to linux nuts and github diehards but also anyone and everyone interested in programming and computers. It's an uphill battle but one I'm particularly interested in, especially as I believe that open source licensing directly benefits human civilization because it is a technology. And technology is a powerful tool when used appropriately by civilized, altruistic people. The more people are digitally literate the better.

For now I'm focusing on what I call "OER Literacy," a sort of companion to digital literacy. Most students aren't aware that legal, free textbooks in computer science are available. OER literacy is the knowledge of where to find such resources, and why you would even want to use them in the first place. College debt is a serious issue, since the opportunity cost of debt when you're young is the equivalent of lost earnings for potentially decades worth of compounding if invested instead. And for the cost of college nowadays, that opportunity cost can easily exceed a million dollars. I wish I were lying but that's the cold facts of a college tuition debt's obligation's worth of index funds (10% average gain annually) compounded over 38 years. 

Open Ed at least offers hope to remedy the situation. I'm sort of hoping for a middle ground in which college prices can decrease by their increasing adoption of opened, but honestly I doubt it will happen. College is just a bit of an unsustainable historical note in the day and age of the internet. I think it'll go the way of telephone operators. What isn't going anywhere is the increasing commitment of future authors and creators to publish their works using open source licensing. That will only increase in prominence and ubiquity and soon the public domain will be so robust that most everyone will be aware that going into debt at age 18 in order to learn computer science just isn't necessary. Online education will be so well developed that people will be able to learn what they want, to the degree that they want, without even thinking or trying. OER literacy needs to be taught as a skill of citizenship. What's the point of writing an open source textbook if no one uses it? And no one using it is a bit of a tragedy, instigated by stigma and misunderstanding and fear of the unknown. Someone I was talking to, for example, thinks linux people are just trying to stick it to the man when I brought up the Lawrence Linux User Group in relation to thanking him for introducing me to Code Topeka. I responded that I'm a capitalist and I subscribe to the notion, admittedly rare, that open source is capitalism in action. I know many people who feel open source is communism. I'm skeptical. While there are some counter-cultural legacies behind the history of open source, I think open source is just "good engineering" dedicated to solving a problem that has arisen out of modern technology and the internet. It is politically and economically neutral. It doesn't require an overthrow of capitalism for a command economy instead to work in open source. I instead think technological advancement helps the free market and liberal democracy, which is what I want, so that's why I do it. To deny that open source is a success or that college has gotten a bit out of hand (with tuition increasing four times the inflation rate) doesn't help anyone nor solves an obvious real problem. People benefit from wanting to learn computer science, because it is such a good industry, that often they rebound from heavy tuition hits, but what about students in other departments? Should everyone else in America just pick themselves up by the bootstraps for not being foresighted enough to be computer scientists? Open Ed at least opens the conversation to talk amongst professionals about what could or needs to be done with regards to current educational practices. It is an interesting source of innovation (although innovation is a bit ironic considering computer science communities have been doing "modern" OpenEd practices for decades).

It's never been a better time to be a lifelong learner and computer scientist. Just about everything you need is free online. Who knew when the internet was invented that free postsecondary education would be its killer app? Thank you to all the computer scientists and authors and programmers who licensed their books and videos using open source licenses and made CS Open Ed a possibility. May many others join your ranks in the future and keep lowering the barriers to entry of becoming a programmer.


## The Best Place to Learn to Code For Free

I have worked in or on EdTech now for three and a half years. In my time studying computer science EdTech, I have come to the conclusion that there is one site that the best place to learn to code for free.

That site is the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

Coding Train is very remarkable. I'm not going to write a glowing review more than is necessary because the reason this is the best coding tutorial website is obvious after watching a couple videos. Daniel Shiffman, as my mom says, is a genius. It is a gift to the world that his remarkable talent for teaching is focused on something as important as computer science and art. If I were an art professor in a college somewhere, I would design my curricula around Daniel Shiffman. I would have my students learn to code, and then create art projects using the same tutorials that Shiffman teaches. That computer science students can also learn to code in such an engaging and creative way is a boon too. The more artist do computer science and the more computer scientists do art, the better.

And the more Daniel Shiffman does programming tutorials, the better the world gets. His tutorials require no purchases (as most common art programming languages do, such as Max/MSP which I learned in art school, which costs $500). You can do his entire programming curriculum on a Raspberry Pi, or a public library computer. Everything is delivered free through YouTube. Daniel Shiffman is the Khan Academy of programming. Naturally, [he's even worked with Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations). That because badasses of a feather flock together. I am a PBS Kid, I grew up watching PBS, and Coding Train is essentially PBS Kids for people who want to learn to program.

No one's ever asked me my recommendations for someone starting programming where to begin. It is my deepest feelings that the simplest first steps would be to buy a new Raspberry Pi with dual monitors for $55, get those dual monitors (or else use a public library computer), and use either your Raspberry Pi with VS Code (or a web IDE if you're on the public library computer) to work through the entire oeuvre of Coding Train videos. Don't just pick them at random, you need to work through the curriculum in an order (starting off learning processing, then p5, then moving on to the more complicated stuff). But if you were to work through the entire library of Coding Train videos, you would be very prepared for a computer science deep dive.

So that's it, I don't have much more to say. My recommendation for people wanting to learn to program: Work through the Coding Train curriculum. Watch all of his videos. Follow along with them in VS Code on your Raspberry Pi. It'll take a long time and require lots of hard work, but you'll be very prepared to be a programmer. And you'll also be skilled enough to make some amazing art!

Daniel Shiffman also publishes some of his written works using CC-BY-NC licenses. That's totally awesome! Good for him for being so progressive as to make OER.

Sometimes there are things you can do that are self-destructive. I think paying for coding tutorials before 100% completing the Coding Train videos would be an example of that. I wouldn't pay for programming lessons before completely exhausting the Coding Train. Only then would I feel it would be necessary to expand onto paid endeavors. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by ignoring a great opportunity when it exists and seeking to start spending money on lessons when you haven't even finished all the free resources. In my opinion, Coding Train being free is one of the best deals on Earth. 100% complete it.

## FI-DOS Manifesto: Financial Independence, Do Open Source

I've been writing a lot of manifestos lately, and I decided there is one more to make. I call this one the "FI-DOS Manifesto," pronouce FIII-DAWS (as in MS-DOS).

It stands for "Financial Independence, Do Open Source." I can summarize it in just a few lines:

Be frugal and save in index funds wisely so that you can become financially independent early in life. Upon becoming FI, Do Open Source.

I think this is so instrumental to the FI computer science scene because the founding fathers of FI, notably Mr. Money Mustache and JL Collins, have both never paywalled their works (one an extensive blog, one a stock series). They are, by all means, "open source." You don't have to pay to read MMM, neither A Simple Path to Wealth.

I note this because the current trajectory of FI bloggers is to learn about FI, make a blog, appear on podcasts and hype your community, then sell publishing rights to a book. I don't understand why these books aren't open source, because the people that taught them what they needed to know -- MMM and JLCollins -- had their blogs open source.

People with the capacity to write a book and are FI need to publish their book as open source. It's silly to come out with a non-open source book when you're FI. Considering the forefathers of FIRE do it, perhaps you should consider doing it too.

It's even better for computer scientists: Once they FIRE, they can focus on open source software and projects.

The same goes for musicians and popular authors and other creatives: Once they're FI, they can release their albums and books as open source.

You could, *gasp*, even facilitate an open source community around your projects, tracking remixes and samplings and forks and derivative works on github or your own personal website. It could be fun, rather than just releasing another copyrighted CD or book to make a few more bucks even though you're plenty well off.

You could create OER (open source textbooks). Teach kids how to do what you became an expert in with no copyright attached to the lessons. It could be used around the globe for free. You could share knowledge instead of attempting to monetize it. For the love of learning. Maybe what you're skilled at helps the globe, instead of hurting it. You could even make a nonprofit around the management of your OER.

Consider open source in your FIRE plans. I think copyrighting your works after FI is just sort of tacky and gauche, don't you? Everything in the future that is digital media is going to be open source or free anyway, all books and music and video tutorials and podcasts (podcasts are already practically open source, as is YouTube effectively since they're free). Why not be an early adopter and make your digital media open source? Personally I can't see any reason against it. Even if you are an entrepreneur. Just google "entrepreneur open source," it's quite possible and reasonable given the way technology is heading.

Again, click on the "anti-copyright" label on the bottom of my page and read the Negativland essay: "Two relationships to a cultural public domain." Anything with the explicit goal of contributing to the public domain is much more valuable to society for millennia than any monetary reward you can achieve by copyrighting your work in the short term of 70 years. Pump in value instead of extracting it.

Contribute to the public domain. FI-DOS, don't just FIRE and start a copywritten blog/book/podcast. Scientists already are in their daily job and soon even entertainment and traditional media will too (support those artists that already do). The early adopters will be the ones that are still read/listened/watched in 1000 years.


## Fi-Dos Part II

Please use Financial Independence tactics to become Financially Independent.

Please get a F-You Degree in C.S. from ages 18-24 for $14,000 dollars and zero debt.

Please work as a developer from age 24-35 and have a savings rate above 60% in order to become financially indendent in 12 years.

Then please go and complete a PhD at the cheapest place you can find. Do this from age 35-40.

Then in your forties and beyond, please spend your Early Retirement making OER (Open Educational Resources) in as many topics as you can. This include books, YouTube lectures, and websites.

OER is the most special open source project you can participate in. Open Source software is already extremely important to human culture, so imagine participating in the most important open source resource: OER.

OER already has revolutionized education in the world. UoPeople can already offer a $4000 undergraduate degree in CS because it uses OER. Anyone that knows English can teach themselves STEM from the textbooks available at [OpenStax.org](https://www.openstax.org). More advanced OERs are catalogged here on this website, covering an entire undergraduate curriculum, and elsewhere. The ability to educate the entire world to an undergraduate level just on cheap cell phones or tablets with internet will make the world develop in such a way as to be entirely unimaginable to foresee. It's like asking you to imagine the unimaginable. When everyone in the world knows English, and an entire college library worth of books are open sourced, education will no longer be limited to the elite and privileged. This requires a lot of advancement in technology, such as providing cheap internet and cheap tablet, but those will advance at the same time OER is advancing. Just as people are dedicated to developing the latest cell phone technology, you should be a person dedicated to the latest in open source educational resources. You will be just as important as the technology gurus. Probably more important. Everyone developing open source technology is remarkably important, it is basically building the infrastructure for a free and progressive, unimpoverished world.

You won't imagine what the world will offer up to your children and great great great great grandchildren when the open source textbooks and videos you create as a FI-DOS practitioner in your forties and fifties trains leagues of scientists in developing nations. You won't imagine how great the world will be when those leagues of scientists, who taught themselves STEM for free using OER, are able to immigrate to America for jobs and start developing new technology, vaccines, sanitation equipment, GMO's, etc etc that will feed and clothe and engender wealth for the entire world. You won't imagine the lush life your great grandchildren will live when they only have to work for 15 years before being able to retire to do whatever creative pursuit they want on their immense cushion of wealth thanks to cheap technology and free open source books and lectures for entertainment.

[You have great reason to be optimistic for the future.](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/10/03/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism/) [We are not really all doomed](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/03/03/why-we-are-not-really-all-doomed/) But that doesn't mean you shouldn't aim at contributing as much as possible to making that optimistic future come as early in human history as possible. Things are good right now, but things will be even better when an entire college library is open sourced and available free for download to anyone in the world. The only way that optimistic future will happen is if people dedicate a whole lot of effort to learning about open source and creating open source educational resources. This website is an attempt at instilling that dedication to open source in others, as I have been an open source evangelist since I was 14 and have no hesitation spreading the good word. The difference in my relation to open source is the awareness that OER is even more valuable than open source code. I was able to train for my first development job relying heavily on OpenCourseWare, and now I realize I could have trained entirely using just OER and OCW. Many people want successful careers but don't have the money to go to college. People need to know that it makes no sense to go to college to learn to program. Computer scientists created open source and computer scientists are leading the way on creating open source educational textbooks. The need for paying for college is long gone. All you need is a $50 Raspberry Pi and the internet, or a Cloud IDE if you only have the public library's computers. Everything else has been provided by philanthropic computer scientists.

Philanthropy is an interesting phenomenon, and only recently have I realized that my life long obsession with open source has actually been a life long obsession with philanthropy in the computer science realm. Sponsoring the writing of open source textbooks, or else doing the dirty work yourself of writing those open source textbooks, is in my opinion a very righteous form of philanthropy. And very effective. Once a textbook has been open sourced, it is free for the rest of history of humanity. Since it is open source anyone can maintain the book if you yourself become tired of it. It can be maintained generation to generation, instead of re-writing the same book over and over it can just be updated as things become updated. It's like compounding interest, only for education. Open source education is the eighth (ninth along with compound interst?) wonder of the world. Its returns are insane.

So, point being, please consider writing and creating open source educational resource if you are on the Holm School path. Since open source educational resources made a debt-free computer science education possible, you should ensure that future generations have debt-free computer science educations (and math, science, art, and on and on) free from the debt-machinery of colleges. Collegial Independence is an interesting phenomenon, honestly I feel pretty alone in my theories some time, but I know that after a few more decades of creating OER, paying for college will be unnecessary. College just can't compete with open source, open source is just too phenomenal in its impact. With Raspberry Pis costing $50 and free computer science textbooks and videos on the internet, there is little reason to spend more than a couple hundred bucks a year on educating yourself. You might think I'm compromising with an inferior education only spending a couple dozen dollars a month on education, but you would be so so so wrong. There is phenomenal education availabe for pennies a day. You should never feel inferior because you don't spend large amounts of money on educating yourself. Your frugality and ninja-like mastery of finding cheap educational resources are the sort of things that will let you do FI-DOS and contribute immensely to the world.

Many people are looking for purpose in their life. I believe immense purpose can be found in creating OER. It's why I made this website. If you would like to feel phenomenal in your Early Retirement, truly consider doing FI-DOS and making OER.

This post was inspired by [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) putting up a 22 hour Linear Algebra video course (free of ads). I have been trying to learn Linear Algebra for a year without finding the motivation to start the LinAlg course on Khan Academy. I am an hour into the video and, rather than being perplexed or overwhelmed as I worried I would be, am following along just fine. This content was created by an OER author (in fact, the same author [listed on this site](https://holm.school/computer-science/#linear-algebra)). I would be lying if I didn't say I started crying knowing that I was receiving an education I longed for in an accessible, free, effective manner through a non-profit who has helped so many people in their own right. After watching this video, I will have no problems diving into Hefferon's textbook or Khan Academy and wrapping up something that's been lingering on my todo list.

OER is amazing. Please join the community if you achieve FIRE as a computer scientist. The more people creating OER, the faster the world will improve beyond even our wildest dreams.




## My Philanthropic Manifesto

I think with some coordinated philanthropy by wealthy people in each state, public libraries could solve the student debt crisis once and for all for the rest of time. My solution does not rely on public universities, because they have proven themselves too self interested to serve the populace and instead of being a university for all citizens, they are so expensive that they are only for the wealthy. Getting a huge student loan just to go to a public state university is probably one of the biggest let downs imaginable to young people.

So my solution comes down to this: Focus my philanthropy on solutions that only focus on computer science departments, so that money isn't wasted funding liberal arts departments that force pomo down young people's throats and don't prepare them for any labor or provide skills. So that thins out the focus of the philanthropy: Any educational institution with a liberal arts department is axed.

Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any public universities that are willing to excise the cancer that is pomo liberal arts departments from their payroll. So instead, STEM students have to fund "philosophers" who think science is colonial, patriarchal, subjective, blah blah blah. Since students at public universities have no option to opt out of funding liberal arts departments, they should avoid them and their overhead. Find a STEM-only educational resource, and go there.

So my personal philanthropy won't focus on computer science departments at any public university. That's okay, because [I'm not comfortable funding a cult](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-Graduate-School-a-Cult-/44676). That's an ethical decision on my part, but I think it's the better one given how many kids are winding up with massive student debt just going to in-state public universities. I think that's because of the bloated liberal arts departments that provide zero utility to students while maximizing the pomo brainwashing in hopes of ushering in the revolution. mmkay, good luck on that. I'm not sure what utility there is in teaching anti-capitalism in the twenty first century but I guess I support free speech (I just don't want to be forced to pay for it as part of my tuition fee).

This leaves us with a few options: Private nonprofit universities that only teach computer science, and private companies that only teach computer science but are not nonprofit. While I would prefer to see a nonprofit service teach computer science to the degree that universities teach computer science, at this point there aren't any services like that. Furthermore, only a few private companies work with public library licensing, the few I can think of are Treehouse and Safari Books. Furthermore, to further filter down the focus of our philanthropy, nonprofit online universities that only have a computer science department thins out to one candidate: University of the People. It's quite a shame that there aren't any other nonprofit universities that only teach computer science. It's quite a good model for an online university: Only teach computer science in order to keep prices as low as possible while maximizing direct utility for the student by teaching one of the most important STEM skill in existence. Why University of the People is the only team providing this important and scalable feature is completely bewildering to me. Given the import of CS, there should be hundreds of competing universities that only have one computer science department, focusing all their online teaching to offering the best CS curriculum at bare-bones rates. I think this is probably the future of computer science education, given how online education will completely eat brick and mortar education in utility as well as cost, and their ability to scale on a national level as opposite to a state level. For now, it looks like University of the People is the best candidate for razor-thin departmental offering, focusing exclusively on computer science (really the only STEM department that can be taught online). So it looks like University of the People is the winner of nonprofit online universities. Perhaps edX will step into the arena and offer a cheap B.S. in CS, but I'm not holding my breath.

Now when it comes to private for-profits that provide computer science education and also provide public library licenses, the candidates are Lynda, Treehouse, and Safari Books. In my opinion, all three of these services are awesome, and I don't feel a need to attempt to cut any particular one out of the running for our philanthropy, instead preferring to rank them according to utility so that funding can be provided one after the other. In my opinion, the ranking goes Treehouse, Lynda, Safari Books, just because Library Genesis provides such an important service that textbooks are the least necessary for CS students. I think using textbooks to learn CS is essential, so I'm not diminishing that, but with Library Genesis on the block, providing free textbooks to anyone savvy enough to use it instead of going broke buying $100 textbooks, and a possible Spotify for Books for $15 a month bound to be invented some day soon -- not to mention the possibility of a student just using free OER for their reading instead of non open source books -- the need to provide CS books in particular is small in this day and age. So if I were to fund CS education at my local public library, I would focus on funding Treehouse first, Lynda second, then Safari Books third.

So here are our current winners: University of the People, Treehouse, Lynda, and Safari Books. In my opinion these services are enough to enable anyone to become a competent enough developer to secure a first job, and then further allowing them to pursue a GATech OMSCS master's degree later so that they maximize their earning potential too. All of these services are affordable enough a hefty donation from a wealthy philanthropist should be able to fund their implementation at a public library in their hometown.

Let me explain what I'm thinking. Let's say someone donates $4 million dollars to establish an endowment for CS learning at their local public library. Assuming that money is investing in VTSAX/VFIAX, that money will provide a 4% withdrawal for the library. That's roughly $160,000 a year. That's a hefty sum, it could basically fund 160 people to study a B.S. in CS at the University of the People a year. Assuming the public library could fund the Lynda and Treehouse subscriptions, that's 160 [F-You Degree students](https://holm.school/the-f-you-degree) a year. That's an amazing service for just $4 million in donations. Fund all the computer scientists in your hometown to get a free bachelor's degree in CS for the rest of eternity, for just $4 million up front. Why governments aren't establishing a University of the People scholarship at their local public libraries is a mystery to me, but I'm willing to let private donations fund it if governments won't do it. They make bank by having massive federal loans taken out by students in perpetuity, so the idea of a nation-wide network of free bachelor's degrees in computer science probably won't take any time soon. It's nearly sufficient that public libraries offer Treehouse and Lynda subscriptions, those are nearly the equivalent of a bachelor's degree if you 100% complete their curriculum mixed with some OER.

So if I were to fund the computer science department at my local public library, I would first ensure that the costs of Treehouse were covered with my endowment. That provides the most utility, considering how cheap it is ($300 a year) while providing everything you need to become a computer scientist. Next up would be Lynda, which is sort of moot since most public libraries offer Lynda anyway, so the endowment would rather promote the use of Lynda to learn computer science rather than fund it (I imagine Lynda is expensive). That leaves University of the People. My unfounded assumption is that Treehouse costs something like $30-50k a year for a library (I assume it scales according to number of accounts), so that leaves about $100k+ for University of the People scholarships. That's still a shitton of free F-You degrees, essentially equivalent to the number of graduates at a small public liberal arts college's CS department. For eternity. For free. The shockingly simple math behind the F-You Degree.

The idea of philanthropists funding free F-You Degrees for all the kids in their town that want to be computer scientists through the public library and a specific CS-only endowment is very realistic and not at all pipedreamish. It's the way things are trending anyway: My public library gives out free Treehouse subscriptions. I studied there at the same time I studied CS (only) at my local public university, and I wound up being job ready in just two years. The total cost was $8000. If I had done University of the People, it would have cost $4000. The public library saved me about $600 with my Treehouse subscription. Since Treehouse AND University of the People is too expensive for a public library, instead they'll have to rely on philanthropists establishing educational endowments. That's fine, especially when just $4 million should be enough to fund more than a 100 F-You Degrees a year. That's a great service to enable in your community, and I know it'll be my personal philanthropic goal to establish such a fund when I'm nearing death. In 50 years, public libraries will probably offer services so good at teaching computer science, no one will feel a need to go and pay for university. I already feel that now with Treehouse and Library Genesis. There's already zero need to go to university to study CS (unless you want a job in academia), so in 50 years it'll probably be even more truthful to an exponential degree. The future is bright for computer scientists, already they can enter the workforce for zero dollars but admittedly two to four years of hard work. More and more affordable CS curricula will be invented, both for-profit and nonprofit, and people will continue to unschool computer science and save enough money to fund early retirement thanks to putting that money in index funds at a young age. It's truly brilliant, and there's no reason to pay it forward as much as you can as a philanthropist and enable free CS education at your local public library. I am thankful for the free Treehouse subscription, and I hope many other people around the nation will get Treehouse at their public library as soon as possible. Philanthropists can accelerate the wait by establishing Treehouse endowments at their public library, and once they pay for Treehouse they can blow past that landmark and pay for UoPeople degrees. Once they pay for that they can blow past and pay for GATech OMSCS degrees. The sky's the limit with affordable online education! Philanthropists should jump into the foray and ensure that these critical services by the public library are funded for eternity. Small investments can do that. The only way people will start using their public libraries for college-equivalent educations is if those services are funded by local philanthropists aiming to improve their community. That is maximized by giving to public libraries to establish CS-specific education endowments, not just contributing to the local university when you die. The return on investment is immense. Instead of just reaching one or two kids, you can affect more than a hundred every year for eternity.

That's my own philanthropic goal. Saving money by skipping college and using the utilities your public library provides basically ensures a great educational experience, when mixed with OER and OCW, and lets you put money that would have been spent on college loans into index funds instead. It's a win-win situation: You become a computer scientist thanks to your public library, and you become financially independent thanks to your frugality matched with having a useful, employable, and high earning skill like programming. Anyone who thinks the answer to high costs of college is to give colleges more money philanthropically is high on their own supply. The answer is the public library, who has a mission of completely free education. Colleges are businesses out to make as much money as possible, and as a result will always be looking out for themselves instead of the students. People go into academia to earn high salaries and cushy tenured positions. Librarians aren't looking out for their bottom line, usually, nor are public libraries attempting to line their own pockets on the public's back. Philanthropy should go towards philanthropic services, not businesses. Just because a college is legally a nonprofit doesn't make it so. Anyone who doesn't realize a college is an income-generating business (for governments as well as private individuals) needs to read more about the student debt crisis.

The idea that I could fund the future education of Topeka's youth when I'm 80 or whatever is quite fun. Online education will continue to get cheaper, so public libraries will continue to offer more and more services related to computer science education. Public universities will get into the race to create affordable online education curricula, just like GATech has done with their OMSCS Master's degree and UoPeople has done with their OER-based B.S. In fifty years, all the money I saved towards this philanthropy will be moot because B.S.es in CS will probably already be paid for by your public library. That's the way things are heading. It's already true that a college is dilapidated thanks to Library Genesis and OCW. This will continue to be the case as private companies provide similar services at $15 a month rates. This kind of growth is only in the computer sciences, because CS invented open source licensing and CS invented the internet. CS has to improve its free education offerings, because CS educations are growing increasingly important as more and more jobs requiring programming skills. CS education isn't a industry where you make a lot of money, instead it is an industry that has some of the highest impact on communities around the nation. In exchange for affordability and smaller profits, online education services are instead enabling more and more people to FIRE and retire early. It's remarkable what cheap but good education can enable when you're not saddled with a hundred thousand dollars of debt at age 22. Being able to max out your 401k and IRA at 22 is instead what creates wealth in communities, and I hope computer scientists will be able to enable through philanthropy future generations of kids to become computer scientists for free thanks to their public library. Computer Scientists + Public Libraries (+ Open Source) is an explosive combination. Unfortunately the dominance of colleges in the public sphere of education is ending thanks to systemic abuse and exploitation almost by necessity. Many kids don't realize that a liberal arts degree is a waste of time and money. STEM degrees are the only proper pursuit for the money, yet we're facing the fact that computer science degrees have been "moved to the cloud," so to speak. Online education is almost better than in-person CS education. You're already on a computer to type in code, so why not just learn to code through that same computer? It's a self-reinforcing circle, and to ignore that benefit is to pay money unnecessarily into an antiquated system. Computers have never been known for having much tolerance for antiquated equipment, and so it's no surprise that online innovations have exceeded the offerings of traditional schools in just the decade since the invention of YouTube. It's computer-led because it's computer-led. Bricks and mortar colleges collapse under their own bloat, their last refuge of competitivity comes from the lingering social superstition towards the value of "prestige" and "degrees". Pretty quaint for a hundred thousand dollars at age 22.

Unfortunately I'm writing about my timetable, and instead of being soon, the timeframe is roughly half a decade. But I'm writing about it in hopes that other people can see what my opinion of where my philanthropic goals are focused on, so that they too can see what they can do to facilitate ubiquitous free F-You Degrees in their hometown. Let's see what innovations we can implement in order to improve society. I'm optimistic!


## Holm School Nonprofit Whitepaper

Online college degrees that source their primary material using Open Educational Resources (OER) have become so cheap as to make it possible for philanthropists to fund entire college degrees in computer science for local students online, rather than just a class or two of select candidates at the local public university. Because online education is a better use of resources when learning computer science (you're working on a computer anyway), public libraries have started subscribing to affordable computer science educational video outlets like Treehouse, Lynda, and O'Reilly Online. This is a good first step, and I have directly benefitted from the Topeka public library's sponsoring of free Treehouse curricula while I was a CS student at Washburn. I learned so much through Treehouse for free that I ultimately quit going to Washburn after 4 semesters to dedicate my study time full-time on Treehouse, hoping to complete their curriculum 100%, scared that the cost would drive TSCPL to stop buying their services after a year or two or the experiment. But because of what I had learned at Treehouse, it wasn't two weeks into my "Holm Schooling" that I got a programming job at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute. Though Washburn was helpful and my professor infinitely kind, the cost to learn at Washburn and Treehouse speaks for itself: Washburn was $8000, and Treehouse was $0. In a sense, I earned a computer science education for much cheaper than was possible even just a few years before. In a sense, it makes sense as a nonprofit/philanthropy to target paying for the cost of TSCPL's Treehouse subscription, rather than attempting to create scholarships for Washburn CS students. The cost differential is staggering. Treehouse costs $300 a year, meaning for my $8000 I spent at Washburn studying eight CS classes I could have bought 26 years of Treehouse. I'm pretty sure in studying Treehouse fulltime for 26 years I could have learned enough to get a programming job. [I'm half kidding.](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/07/interview-with-a-ceo-ridiculous-student-loans-vs-the-future-of-education/)

Holm School will attempt, over the next twenty or so years, to build up enough of an endowment that it can sustainably subsidize the TSCPL's computer science education budget. I don't mean to disappoint -- This is not an immediate philanthropy. It's an attempt to create a nonprofit that can slowly earn enough of an endowment to, in the future when online education is even cheaper, pay for all Topekans to learn computer science through the public library. In twenty years, it will probably be very important for most workers to know computer science/programming. But it's already the case that it is completely possible to learn computer science for free using OER. There is no "educational gap" that needs to be filled in the timeline of the Holm School nonprofit. Anyone interested in studying computer science free can already get a college-equivalent education for free using online resources and OER (and the public library). What the twenty years timeline of this nonprofit is is to scrape together an endowment to sustainably pay the TSCPL's CS budget in perpetuity [using the 4% rule](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/12/07/stocks-part-xiii-withdrawal-rates-how-much-can-i-spend-anyway/) and putting the endowment in a Total World Stock Market index fund. Each $100,000, then, will sponsor $4000 of Treehouse a year. Given a vanilla Treehouse account is $300 a year, that (back of the envelope) can pay for 13 Treehouse accounts. As we grow our endowment, we can contribute more and more to the total cost of Treehouse for the TSCPL, at which point we can move our sights away from just sponsoring Treehouse but eventually sponsoring college degrees.

Right now, you can earn a bachelor's of science degree from [University of the People](https://uopeople.edu) for $1000 a year for four years total. Treehouse completely suffices for training someone to learn enough programming so that they can secure their first junior development job. But most users don't realize that Treehouse is basically a free college education. They don't realize that they don't need a degree to be a programmer, especially a junior one, and that in fact, most programming jobs pay for tuition reimbursement as a benefit, so that they could learn at Treehouse to get a job, but then get a B.S. degree in Computer Science from UoPeople for free through tuition reimbursement from their job. My job covers $3000 a year in tuition reimbursement. UoPeople is $1000 a year. 'nuff said. I could get a B.S. degree for free if I wanted to, paid by my employer. I could continue on and get a master's in C.S. from GATech OMSCS for $7k total, divided by 3-6 years ($1.2k per year. Point being, I could get a bachelor's and master's degree in CS for free just through tuition reimbursement at my (paid) programming job. This is because online education has become so completely affordable through philanthropic endeavors like UoPeople and GATech OMSCS that $1000 a year is enough to fund a college education for a Topekan. That's a pretty radical opportunity to grok when a single class at Washburn costs $1000. In such a way, Holm School's goal of promoting computer science education in Topeka is better spent targeting Treehouse and UoPeople, rather than funding Washburn scholarships. I don't mean to pick on Washburn, but if Washburn can't create a $1000 a year C.S. degree, then as a nonprofit we have to turn our gaze towards another opportunity to fund computer science in Topeka if the numbers just won't scale compared to online educational nonprofits. A bricks and mortar campus just can't compete in costs compared to an online education that uses open source OER.

I firmly believe that in the future, you will earn your college degree through the public library using an affordable online college that the public library pays tuition for. In a sense that's already the case with Treehouse, it's basically a college education when paired with OER and the public library's CS stacks, but it doesn't earn you a degree (not that it's needed if you consider my note above about tuition reimbursement coming along with most programming jobs). If the Holm School nonprofit could fund not only Treehouse, but also scholarships to UoPeople for as many people as the 4% rule would allow for our endowment, we could basically offer a first-class computer science education for Topekans. One that would ultimately culminate in them receiving a computer science degree. By the time we fund this, of course, a CS degree will probably not even be necessary for most programmers. Online education will be destigmatized and the huge buffet of open source educational resources will be such a literal cornucopia of knowledge for free (it basically already is right now) that paying hundreds of thousands of dollar for a traditional degree will make little sense. Ironically it is computer science that is making the computer science degree no longer necessary. This nonprofit could be so fatuously unneeded by the time it is fully funded (consider Treehouse or PluralSight or Lynda or O'Reilly Online or any other EdTech for just $100 a year in ten years coupled with a Raspberry Pi that only costs $35), that it will be so affordable that a nonprofit like this is uneeded. Of course, at that points maybe there will be a "github" for educational computer science videos ("gittube"?) that even the idea of paying $100 a year for educational videos is incomprehensibly outdated. But still, people will probably remain skeptical of "open source" and still feel the compulsion that only education you pay for is worthwhile. In which case, perhaps a degree from a UoPeople competitor will just cost $300 a year, and so forth. Even that is worth subsidizing the public library, because it is possible to fund 40 college students a year at UoPeople at this very moment with a $1 million endowment. A $1m endowment is possible just fund-raising $15k a year for twenty years, invested in a total stock market index. As more people learn computer science for free through the Topeka Public Library, the more computer science startups will happen in Topeka, and the more people there will be in Topeka willing to donate to a computer science education scholarship fund.

College is not Luxury Time, it's Asskicking time. If you are willing to... home school... which is very feasible given how easy it is to follow along and learn at Treehouse (which can lead to you using OER to further your studies to the point where you can get a college-equivalent education for free), you can eek out a junior development job (certainly after four years of full time study) with an investment cost possibly as low so that a few hours of working a week at a minimum wage job can cover the tuition expense. I don't care what people say about college degrees in other fields, a degree in computer science is not necessary to work as a programmer. Is years of hard study? Yes, that is necessary. But is a degree? No. Can you kick ass studying at home on Treehouse or at UoPeople using OER and your public library? Yes. There is a huge amount of free educational resources for learning computer science, there is simply a stigma against being "self-taught" online and hence why people pay tens of thousands of dollars for what they could learn free working hard in their bedroom on a Raspberry Pi using OER and github. I work in computer science for the very reason I believe computer science is capable of bestowing a computer science education to anyone online for chump change in costs. All the signs I've watched as an amateur sociologist of higher education (that was my senior year thesis topic at Reed) in relation to computer science indicate that CS education will be on the order of hundreds of dollars a year if you are willing to learn online rather than a bricks and mortar college. I'm trying to facilitate a larger understanding of OER and EdTech by funding people's educational costs through the Topeka Public Library. I wouldn't be doing this endeavor if the Topeka Public Library wasn't brave enough to pay for Treehouse on my behalf. Because they were, I've had a successful programming career in which I'm able to think of repaying the gratitude I feel to the Topeka Public Library through philanthropy such that other people can continue to experience the rich educational experience of Treehouse (or whatever equivalent exists in 20 years time) for free. As educational resources are only going to get cheaper as time goes on, I don't feel like this is an extremely unrealistic goal for a twenty year timespan.
